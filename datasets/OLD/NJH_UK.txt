WTF! @patel4witham why is this happening &amp; why are you not doing your job!?!? Arrival of asylum seekers in village sparks complaints and compassion https://t.co/0zttUFVMlw
@Nigel_Farage Thank you Nigel we just don’t know what the hell is going on,it all gets brushed over,the government was voted in to stop this sort of thing from happening,these are illegals @BorisJohnson @patel4witham
@NinaBel37067005 @BlueEyesTC @Nigel_Farage @Conservatives PUTTING YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AT RISKSend illegals straight back not setting foot on British soil
@KTHopkins @NorfolkPolice Any idea why only 5% of illegals are currently being deported? - it's utter madness - 100% should be deported.
@Nigel_Farage Nigel smuggle your way into france see if you can do it...then fuk off as im sick listening to your boring immigrant dribble it aint going away we have a pandemic..have a fag and a pint..chillax..get used to it..
@NeilJon14403043 @CCharlesworth2 @NinaBel37067005 @Nigel_Farage The Far Right believe the anti-immigrant  nonsense the MSM churn out every day. Many hate Asian paedos but never say anything about British going to Thailand to have sex with kids, many are also paedos themselves as the EDL criminals website shows.
@SocialDemSheff @PeterR3001 @lewis_goodall @Nadjdaniela They opened the door to privatisation of NHS. They constantly lied to us and are responsible for the lack of trust in our party. They killed innocent Iraqi citizens with an illegal war. Great job!
@boblister_poole Deport! You behave like that, you lose the right to live in our country...
@patel4witham @NSPCC Never mind the fact your endangering everyone by letting illegals stay with no checks or tests
@BorisJohnson We paid for the financial crash, we paid for the Eu,  we pay for all the migrants and illegals we give everything we have to have a slap in the face. Soon we will have to pay for this virus too. Omg!
@luegnerdetector @WilliamHayesWo1 @terrychristian I’m an immigrant came here in the 60s Britain helped me raise 4 kids n 9 grandkids , I love Britain and all it’s diversity I’m extremely content and happy , I detest the lefty loons and what there doing to democracy and freedoms , I’m not the one wiv a daft pro Eu account 
@KTHopkins @NorfolkPolice Well said young lady....why should we*adhere to the rules/laws whilst the criminals/asylum\illegal immigrants dont need passports.....do what they want......why bother?#uk#joke
@LadyMercia Deport
@Glasgow_Live Deport this scumbag back to a jail in Sri Lanka
@BoerboelUK @ConstantinStHe1 How to stop the illegals coming here by boat.Leaflet drop to all migrant camps."From now until 31St December the UK border force will be replaced by SAS and Gurkha regiments"
@DominicRaab It’s out of the bag Boris !!!   . Stop the illegals , send back those already here. It’s out of hand and WILL damage you’re next election chances.
@rez_shariati @PatriciaHalste1 @Complyorcry @Nigel_Farage Absolutely not. These illegals should be stopped. Especially at a time when there is a pandemic. We are all under virtual house arrest and these people are allowed in freely. The only people profiting here are the criminal people traffickers who are exploiting people.
@OrdoNatur @nationaltrust @NIAbbot The only non immigrants in this world are the black people in Africa who haven't moved to another country. Everyone else is an immigrant like it or not. That's how every other country was made, built on immigrants.
@LadBonnie There’s no end of this shite ,deport and drain the swamp of these scumbags they’re not wanted.
Exactly as @fotoole predicted. Blaming migrants for his fatal inadequacies. Truly pathetic when Mexico only has a minute proportion of the 70,000 fatalities in USA. https://t.co/0uto5ml7jo
I sat through all 3 minutes of this snivelling shit feigning concern about dangerous channel crossings and modern slaveryNo doubt he'll support increased financial aid for asylum seekers above it's currently pitiful level of £37.75 a week, &amp; the opening up of safe passages then https://t.co/brW1I59Zc2
@JonPalm46730999 @SimonJonesNews @Nigel_Farage There is no refugee crisis I am afraid- it's just people like Nigel and the Daily Mail that have lodged that concept in your small brains. I am fairly confident that anyone desperate enough to cross the channel in a boat like that would be happy to pick fruit and veg for us...
@Glasgow_Times Another migrant beast on our streets.Glasgow is full of them.
Imagine if an MP'S daughter was sexually assaulted ..  bet things would change then  ! Get this scum and the grooming gang rapists deported now !! https://t.co/ILTPQUBHgC
Dear @BorisJohnson - Stats show that 600 illegal invaders entered the UK since lockdown. These are only the 'known' ones 'intercepted' by Border Control &amp; escorted to a pleasant new life on the backs of the UK taxpayer. Why cannot you stop this? Now. @patel4witham https://t.co/MsVCx4lULR
Yes you too boris ,a thousand illegal immigrants crossed the channel so far this year,fuck knows what diseases they have or who they are,,great work boris,,and don't forget to give yourself a big pat on the back for doing nothing to get rid of the 1.5 million illegals here now https://t.co/nxxEHTlUpW

Our country needs to waken up, these people are not migrants or asylum seekers, they are illegal immigrants, they have committed a crime coming into our country “illegally“, most other countries in the world would jail them, then organise their deportation as soon as possible. https://t.co/Cak7OF7gzg

@NursingNotesUK True hero’s deserve better. All Imigrants working in NHS / Social Care ,no matter their ethnicity deserve full British Citizenship. How many lives saved through their actions? How would the NHS and Social Care manage without them? Collapse probably! Reward them now @BorisJohnson

@NinaBel37067005 @Nigel_Farage Perhaps our country can reflect on the fucked up history of the British empire and modern Britain. The effects of divide and rule, and recent oil wars in the Middle East and Africa are the reasons that have led to the refugee crisis we see today.

@mytopteam @SportyWigan @Nigel_Farage Imagine if our lads had fled during WW2 and left all the women and children behind.  Most of them aren't seeking asylum, they are economic migrants.  They still need healthcare/education/etc that British tax payers have to pay for.  Disgusting.

@Nigel_Farage I can’t imagine for second how awful it must be existing in your fetid mind. And the narrative has changed if you took your head out of the sand. Migrant workers keeping the NHS afloat. That must upset your stomach ulcer. Change the record PayPal Nige...

Typical Tory bullyboy councillor becomes abusive when one of the most astute 17yr olds on Twitter calls out their bog standard anti-refugee xenophobia.

@Jonathan_MBanks @Nigel_Farage @kent_police Hah, Farage being accused of breaking lockdown "protocol" by lefty liberal open border Marxists , meanwhile, hundreds of illegal migrants roll up onto our beaches, but that's ok, insane
Why didnt the illegals comming to the UK by boat adhere to the French lockdown, they didn't give a shit. https://t.co/IoMSnt7wAd
@rachshabi Hard right?!?  I am an immigrant and the Conservatives are amazingly inclusive. Our fantastic hardworking Tory  MP is gay and from a working class background. Welcome to the new Conservative Party! We are the future and your style of divisive politics is the past.
@RemainerNow Those aren’t illegal immigrants coming over, they are potential migrant fruit and veg farm workers doing the jobs that British people don’t want to do! 
@benzderpiraat @RotesKreuz_CH When will the world rescue Iraqi asylum seekers &amp; refugees from the sea of suffering which they have drown in it for 3to6 years?They need urgent help to reach resettlement to save their children future after the horrible events they've livedIn Turkey
@BrettEverest Round the lot up and deport everyone of their arses back to where they came from  every country in Europe and us in Britain should take back our countries
in such contexts, what could it possibly mean that a cabinet minister in a govt which has deported black citizens to their deaths &amp; keeps asylum seekers in privately-run prison camps wants you to know he has David Irving &amp; both Race Murrays in his bookshelf? Oh, nothing, probably
Why don’t you protect our communities and stop all these bloody illegals running up the beach everyday!!FFS https://t.co/xzEaBwgd4I

@therewasahedge @Nigel_Farage Leaving the EU is exacerbating the illegal immigrant problem. Thanks Nigel.
@Jonathan_MBanks @Nigel_Farage @kent_police No it's not a breech at all. It's called REAL journalism for once. Let's see if you care so much for the lock down protocol when all the mosques are full over Ramadan.Is it him breaking protocol or the covering of this scandal that you're clearly offended by ?Stop illegals
@KTHopkins @NorfolkPolice Every country in Europe has more illegals than the uk , and it’s also a global problem, our home office is one of the most ruthless on the planet, so what do you suggest KT ?? Drive them back in to the sea with fixed bayonets?Nazi !
@Boxneeds23 @barnumseed @KTHopkins @NorfolkPolice Asylum seekers aren’t illegal immigrants you fucking cunt. You’re an embarrassment to this country

Disgraceful &amp; it needs to be stopped.Existing UK Border Force is totally unfit for purpose &amp; should be dismantled &amp; decommissioned.Priti Patel needs to start it up all over again &amp; put people in charge with hostility towards these economic immigrant criminals. https://t.co/BWMg6JVxVG

@fastcarspete The EU is predominantly white. There was open door to white Europeans but stricter controls on, what you referred to as "brown people". That sounds a bit racist to me.Now we can control immigration and have a merit based system, rather than the EU's race based system... https://t.co/DzlLaXTPgg
@KTHopkins @NorfolkPolice I honestly believe that these illegals are drifting half a mile off the coast of France then just waiting to be picked up by the boarder force aka illegal taxi service.This is a disgrace and a slap in the face of those who voted for stronger border control by voting for brexit
these migrant workers have been forced into the mindset that theyre "lower" than us, they know exactly how we view them. for them they just want to come here and earn money for their families back home. theyre willing to put up with the horrendous way we treat them

@Nigel_Farage If people are in our territorial waters or boarders and claim asylum until their case is heard they are not illegal migrants but asylum seekers but then you know that but it doesn’t suit you racist and xenophobic rhetoric.
@Nigel_Farage Fake news. No evidence to back up your claims on what you saw. You told lies during the referendum campaign with that disgusting picture of immigrant lines and you continue to lie. Just go home!
@Steven41849941 @SimonJonesNews @Nigel_Farage Life is challenging for illegals. They certainly don’t get benefits, housing etc. You probably bought into that ‘pensioners get £6k a year, illegals get £29k’ bollocks. You know, you also have to share this planet with people who came here illegally. 
@SloughForEU Why isn't he being challenged for travelling beyond what's allowed, this is his latest rant over people crossing the channel, personally I'd swap any Syrian refugee for him on the understanding that the bastard is made to live in Syria

@NorbertMedley @exposed_drama @sobbathe @noraa_brown @stephen63108166 @lukegrice00 @keke__e @ancientorigins Crying isn't gonna turn asylum seekers into immigrants.
@Nigel_Farage @lewis_goodall Was that your report from a deserted beach with not an illegal immigrant to be been?
I can only assume that the "illegal migrant scandal" is that migrants coming into the country at Dover were tested for Covid-19 and "it is not right" that migrants are tested using British resources, according to Tory MP @NatalieElphicke.  Despicable people. https://t.co/2THWLdkEzp
@Stevie96008787 @KTHopkins @NorfolkPolice That's just an excuse for your ignorance. Vouchers aren't the same as money. I don't think a £38 voucher is much anyway. I say give it to them if they're genuine asylum seekers escaping a war. If they're economic migrants then send them back. You seem to be against both.
@Nigel_Farage It's amazing they have the time to take an interest in your welfare with all those illegals to be checking out.
@PatWill97926440 Kier will skillfully hold boris to account ,, --//// Wilfully not mentioning open border genocide
@maskedalien52 @AltNewsMedia Lovely casual racism there Just a FYI. Just because someone isn't white it doesn't mean that they're weren't born in the UK. If that is the case, where would you deport them to? And why should their family be deported too?
Must be great to belong to the right wing.Toby Young and Sarah Vine can just explain away racism by claiming it was “satirical”. Nigel Farage does it by pretending there’s an immigrant “scandal”.The rest of the country are not held by such piss weak standards. https://t.co/Z8MbFTeBiY
@cristine_foster @freespeech318 @KTHopkins @NorfolkPolice @patel4witham Is it illegal immigrants being housed in this lovely hotel in the North West @patel4witham @BorisJohnson @Conservatives British people are fed up to the back teeth of this nonsense. Deport them not house them! They are here illegally! #GetThemOut #wehavehadenough
I would happily pay for the total cost of that police incident just to see Farage shit himself https://t.co/l9kZBVG3qE
@Nigel_Farage It is essential travel Nigel, you are representing millions with the same view who are very upset that illegals are invading our shores and we thank you for all your great efforts.If I lived down the coast I would personally send you videos of these invaders.
@Sammyt108 @KTHopkins @NorfolkPolice Oh really?So the rest of Europe is totally uncivilised and does not take asylum seekers.If they were genuine migrants they would apply via the legal routes to do so.Get a grip man!
@Nigel_Farage Travelling to Dover to report on the illegal migrant scandal taking place was indeed a total waste of time and money.
They're doing nothing to protect us, except ferrying illegals into the country.Who know who they are, terrorist, murderers, rapist's, it obviously doesn't bother our government.@patel4witham @10DowningStreet @Conservatives https://t.co/eU9UQK9jjX
@NorbertMedley @exposed_drama @sobbathe @noraa_brown @stephen63108166 @lukegrice00 @keke__e @ancientorigins So why did you call them illegal immigrants if you knew what asylum seekers are?
@NorbertMedley @exposed_drama @sobbathe @noraa_brown @stephen63108166 @lukegrice00 @keke__e @ancientorigins You don't need to claim asylum in the first country you enter. This argument is old and boring. Next.
@Nigel_Farage Stop illegals
If u a migrant tries to beat u up n U win that fight u are going to prison for a long time n theyll put u in with the gangs who will serve u some of their own sjw "justice" so be careful out there original british people.
@Nigel_Farage What illegal migrant scandal? You never cared about all the English girls being raped because they are not rich.

@Nigel_Farage We’re angry about you, read the UN Agreement on the status of asylum seekers, you ignorant bigot, or do you magically know they are not. The agreement we signed up to states their rights and the process to be followed.

@newmoo41 @NationalistFurn Him and his party still letting in illegals is driving me nuts. Claim to be conservative, maybe today's "modern day conservative" he would fit in, which are practically globalist libtards.
@Andy_Irving @Nigel_Farage I hope they knock on your door. Not the police, the illegals.
Whoever that mutha fucka was that asked about tracking people needs to be forced to apply for British citizenship...And deported.
@JimMFelton @Nigel_Farage Whys its racism? They are illegals entering the country. Why should they be let in? Idiot.

@Nigel_Farage Going out to stir up a bit of anti-immigrant hate is hardly essential work. You should be ashamed of yourself.

@Nigel_Farage ... not only the fact these illegals maybe entering illegally with Covid-19 virus.
@Nigel_Farage Did they tell you to stop being a racist facist cunt? Next time you feel like a trip to the sea, just wade out into the water, then keep going, you might find an illegal boat full of immigrants just over the horizon. Ask the Dolphin who beat you in the 2010 GE for directions.
@festung18802 @KTHopkins @NorfolkPolice If asylum seekers land in a safe country first , the UK has the authority to deport them back to say France. So to say all asylum seekers come from France is ludicrous.

@Nigel_Farage Interesting that you can determine that they're illegal immigrants and not refugees or asylum seekers from on top of that cliff, Nigel.
@Nigel_Farage Wonderful!  Why don't they be useful and warn the illegal immigrant regarding essential travel and forthwith deport them back to France for breach of this Country's emergency regulations. No need to delay, these are emergency regulations and they could be carrying a killer virus.

@Nigel_Farage Why I’m I made to stay in my house for more that 6 weeks !!!! And everyone of these illegals could be covid 19 positive ????
@Nigel_Farage How ridiculous, maybe the police could be of better use stopping people entering the country illegally. They are all breaking asylum law by not seeking asylum in the first safe country.  They're not even being tested for Covid 19!!
@biscuitsgod @Nigel_Farage He is obeying them you moron. He's a broadcaster and politician. Travelling to Dover to report on an Illegal invasion is his job. It cannot be done from home.

@PaulMer52 Your proposals are a weeny bit unrealistic. All illegals should be removed and sent home but you've got to find them first!  We are reaping what deceitful men sowed all those years ago persuading the people we were joining a trading block. We know too late it was NWO in progress.
Priti Patel ..... STOP the Illegals NOW! https://t.co/pYxTEktQre
Who are these anti British lawyers? Deport them along with the illegals! https://t.co/PdAFCxEjP0
@Nigel_Farage What a joke! Obviously, the continuing illegal immigrant migration must be allowed to continue unhindered. How strange that the UK population has restricted movement, but trips across the Channel continue unabated.
Horrific I know, but when are the govt going to deal with this, crack down on immigration and deport anyone who refuses to adapt to our way of life. This is what feminists and diversity groups should be tackling, not defending a blokes right to use women's toilets. https://t.co/X5y4f8u8OW
@JimMFelton @shakimiki Wouldn’t surprise me if Farage is uncloaked as Mr Big responsible for all the illegal immigration after all he’s only in Blighty because of his illegal immigrant ancestors who sailed across from France as asylum seekers.
@Nigel_Farage "I had been to Dover to report on the illegal migrant scandal taking place.What a total waste of time and money." I agree
Look at this illegal migrant in Dover, breaking the law.  Surname sounds a bit foreign too.  Lock him up. https://t.co/XRsleqOPVq
and obviously contact your MPs as well; we should be looking after everyone who we can, not trying to pick and choose based on fucking visa status.
@berylharris21 I think we can all work out where you're at Beryl. The stuff you choose to retweet tells a very different story to your oh so innocent protestations. People on here are not as daft as you think. Bargoed is hardly an immigrant 'hotspot' is it?
@Nigel_Farage what the hell ? Nigel Farage is more than a KEY worker he tells it as it is unlike the pratts in the BBC who don't report on the truth, like illegal migrant scandal taking place.
@Nigel_Farage All the people on this thread who want all these illegals in our country should take them into their own homes and look after them , lets see what happens then , these people inviting their own demise, I just can't fathom their logic.
@minecrafter420y @editor_wp @KTHopkins naw its good she made it. she's an immigrant and she's staying here forever xx so glad the government let her and  her daughter live here x

@DevonshireDanUK @EnglishGent79 How long before these illegals will have the right for their families to join them in UK ?   @patel4witham @HouseofCommons @BorisJohnson @Conservatives
@markoftheD @Nigel_Farage So your saying those workers in hospitals and care homes are illegal immigrants or are you just spouting tosh . Don’t compare illegals to legal immigrants because your insulting those who chose to move and work here legally  belittling them saying there no better than illegals
@JackDunc1 How is it rascist. If these are genuine asylum seekers fleeing persecution then why do they leave their wives, sisters, mothers and daughters behind (to continue to be persecuted?)? Ppl like u are unbelievably naive. Most of them r economic migrants jumping the queue
@bbclaurak @PoliticalPics In an independent Scotland stooges like you would need a special visa to be allowed to work here. Doubt even then you'd qualify. Can't wait. #Lickspittle #Sycophant
@KTHopkins @CDennett You know full well the point they're making is that people who voted for Brexit and anti-immigrant voters are out clapping for an NHS that is full of immigrants, the very people they don't want in our country. But yep, go ahead and make it an 'anti-white' thing.

@MigrationWatch I can't believe some twat pm's me saying they should be allowed into the country. Fecking idiot. 5 million out of work, poverty all around us. Multiple occupancy slum homes. Travelled many continent's illegally. Claim asylum in the 1st country or arrive legally. Simple
@Nigel_Farage These illegals are a disaster for our beautiful country!!!Keep up the good work Nigel.
@OldCodger15 The economy is crashing, British citizens are losing their jobs daily, if the ungrateful bastard isn't happy with a free home and £37 a week, he can fuck off back to wherever he snuck in from.He also should have sought asylum in the first safe country he came too, not the UK!
@hoveboy @MirrorPolitics @DailyMirror Why not lock up the illegals landing here illegally.
@KTHopkins @Nigel_Farage @BorisJohnson #StopTheBoats #StopTheBoatsNow #SinkTheBoats Drown the buggers, get every illegal immigrant out and the criminals deported as soon as they are released. How many potential terrorists are you going to let into the Country #BorisJohnson
@IsabelOakeshott @Nigel_Farage He's an illegal migrant breaking the law and endangering innocent people.
@KTHopkins @NorfolkPolice Asylum seekers are not illegal immigrants. Saying they are isn't plain speaking, it's lying to whip up hate.
Reporting is allowed - so that was foolish on behalf of the "police".Why not question the BBC for the lack of daily figures and pictures, of the open to migrant policy we seem to be running here in UK?Or better still acting on Nigel's findings, and proactively protecting UK? https://t.co/SGuAMWj8BF
@KathyBurke @johnsweeneyroar Kathy migrant camps coming to your neighbourhood soon NOT. You horrible looking TNUC
She must know once they get here it is harder to send them back....which begs the question why the hell don’t we send patrol boats further out into the channel, intercept them and return them back to France https://t.co/CWbzYmRDjY
Farage: Look! Another immigrant! Definitely an immigrant. Look at his horrible foreign toady face!Cameraman: Erm. Nige, that's your reflection in the water mate.Farage: Watch out! Police! Quick! Do star jumps! Nothing to see here officer. Just doing racism, I mean exercise!
@Kazbar1966 @KathyBurke Herr Farage's coverage is superficial. He doesn't say anything about what the Border Force does when they apprehend illegals. He's merely  stoking up blind racism and self-publicity. #Fascist @Devon4Europe @NDevon4Europe @Cornwall4EU
@typejunky Aye, and a twat like that wouldn't dress like Paddington, because Paddington was an illegal immigrant. :-)
@Independent Here come all the nasty racists, they’re asylum seekers not immigrants.Perhaps if we stopped bombing half the planet people wouldnt be running
@EwanClark94 @ChrissieGrech @brexit_sham @Nigel_Farage And what's your solution? Throw them back into the sea to drown? Deport them? They are human beings too. How about putting them to work in the fields picking the crops  Brits won't because it's too hard work? Likely they'd be willing to do it.
I think @patel4witham thinks with all this coronavirus going on, this news is going to go under the radar. How wrong she is. Folk's are thinking why should we be made to stay indoors when these illegals are just rolling in everyday. @BorisJohnson https://t.co/pwVpOaLYis

@Nigel_Farage How can you tell through the windows of a Vauxhall that a person is an illegal migrant being given a taxi ride? Is it just that they 'look a bit foreign, not our sort'? Also you're on course for another doorstep bollocking for unnecessary journey. Do do your racism at home Nige.
@dantheplumber2 @TesticleOReilly @dollybut @LyndonRosser @PeterGr15493594 @Nigel_Farage The reality is you are no longer free to do what you want in England. All your EU immigrant loving buddies can get together. But the Brits won't break. We survived the Nazis we will throw you and the illegal immigrants oit the same way.
@JimMFelton @Nigel_Farage How is concern about invasion by unvetted illegals coming to sponge off the state racist? It's pathetic to hear the word racist used constantly.
“They” use the word “asylum seekers”. Blink blink.Coz they probably bloody are asylum seekers. Most governments of the world are even more crass and brutal than New Labour. Doesn’t take much imagination.This woman assists leftists by removing all moderation from the right. https://t.co/WLRcqI5WTj

@Bollocks_Dogz @johndmtb Why don't we use a cruise ship anchored in the channel to house illegal migrants rather than bring them ashore. Next time the Calais ferry goes passed then they can be sent back...They are not asylum seekers they are economic illegals
I refuse to be under house arrest while this goes on and our incompetent and complacent government does nothing. That's it for me. Can't  go for a drive without being fined while illegals arrive and mix freely, unhindered? To hell with that. @BorisJohnson @patel4witham https://t.co/3FpGw1qeDq

They also get refugee status &amp; go on to contribute a lot into the system
@GortTheAvenger @ninnyd101 @patel4witham Anyone that gets that job. No matter who it is wouldn't have the balls. To have planes on the runway with their engine's running ready to ship illegals straight out. No if's or but's.

@fredchapman46 @LadBonnie Your message was hidden with a warning if want to view. Ffs what is wrong with wanting to deport illegal criminal scumbags?

@VonSkinnback @ThePoke @Nick_Pettigrew @BorisJohnson_MP @grahamlithgow @JimMFelton @TheIDSmiths His Hugenot ancestors were asylum seekers fleeing Catholic France (Hugenot were Protestant). So he is much less British than me. But I don't believe in his hypocritical attitude. I welcome the fact people feel that UK is a place of safety. Judge each migrant on their own merit.

@ck20891 @ManiReturn @JimMFelton @Nigel_Farage It has nothing to do with being racist, the second you cheapen that word I loose all interest in your argument. To claim asylum you need to go to the nearest safe country NOT the country that gives the most Money.
@Nigel_Farage Illegal immigrant scandal? Farmers just had to pay the charter a plane to go get some Eastern Europeas  to work in the fields. IMO you're toxic, spreading hate for profit and your own personal vendettas. You've caused enough damage go away.

@Nigel_Farage "Illegal migrant scandal". Get a fucking grip you pound shop fascist.
@MartinDaubney What is wrong with removing these illegals straight back to France as soon as they are picked up.Those who get here under the radar, especially since Coronavirus lockdown, what diseases have they got, this is a time bomb waiting to explode in our faces and Government do damn all
@JimMFelton @Nigel_Farage I love the Racist card. It's for those who can't hold a debate.  Oh and can I ask how many asylum seekers you've taken in yourself? I bet it's the same number as @Nigel_Farage isn't it? Your a racist yourself then?
@Nigel_Farage Nigel,I voted for you before and I would vote for you again.A new party?Stop immigration.Stop illegals.Deport convicted immigrants.Abolish the house of Lords.End BBC funding.
@EmWilmo @Nigel_Farage @patel4witham Why the hell should we be on lock down when illegals are still coming to the UK defeats all our efforts.

@AndyWalker9 @KTHopkins @Nigel_Farage @BorisJohnson "racism" is thinking people inferior because of "race" illegal immigrants not a good idea not because of race but because they cost a lot and don't pay taxes: each illegal immigrant costs £36K P/A. This month  600. Over the next year this will cost £20,448,000.” April 30th  2020
I look forward to the day when the police spot Nigel Farage on a beach somewhere and arrest him as a potential illegal immigrant.

This is what people like Farage often do. They plant a seed that the police/authority are against free speech and pretend to be oppressed when actually the police were enforcing the lockdown rules and doing their jobs. The police don’t give a shit about your views on immigration https://t.co/K3l58Yg2t2

@Lewis_3636 @KTHopkins @NorfolkPolice Are you stupid?The law says an Asylum seeker should apply in the first Country they get to.Not the last. 
@Nigel_Farage Questions are : why come in illegally?Why not be admitted through the appropriate channels? Are there any previous convictions? Rape, murder, assault?Why are the majority men?Are they carrying a virus, any virus?Why not seek asylum at the first safe country?
@GazWillis2 @SkyeCity_ I agree with your assessment of Thatcher-there is very little in it.But if you were a Grenfell victim or a #Windrush victim or family of or one of the 130K killed by social care policies or Assange or black or Muslim or poor or an immigrant, you would think this lot are worse.
@mrjamesob @smh You'd think that a government elected after pushing narratives about border control and immigrant scapegoats would have been prepared to close those borders to prevent a contagion and protect its citizens.  It's almost like the whole narrative was made of utter bollocks.

@MartinDaubney @Nigel_Farage Martin, I see the, "I love would be disease ridden jihadi lovers" are out in force! These people that make excuses for them are just as bad as the illegals themselves!

@Souts_Alivand You should go on Bake Off. Those metros wouldn't know what to make of a young woman, a refugee from a Muslim theocracy, baking cakes decorated with the Union Flag and 'Vote Tory'. It'd blow their fecking minds!

@BoerboelUK We know, they know, everyone knows they are no more asylum seekers than the man in the moon. So let’s drop the pretence. They’re economic migrants attracted by British generosity.

#Conservatives what is going on with Channel Migrants? Priti Patel get a grip.A huge vote loser brewing for the Tories if you don't stop and deport. Why are you rewarding and therefore encouraging illegals by helping them get here and not returning them immediately when they do? https://t.co/nknwhtU3Np
@Nigel_Farage yes your report on the illegal migrant scandal was a total waste of time and money.
@AporeticD @AnnJarvis13 Very true.There are migrants, asylum seekers, refugees etc. None arrive as "illegal immigrants"
Deport all foreign criminals currently in the Justice system.Round up all Illegals &amp; deport them.Any foriegner that comits a crime in the UK is automatically deported back to there native country.This would clear the backlog in Prisons, the foreign office &amp; save us billions. https://t.co/apf7Ohty3m

@CDennett @AutobBig @TechnicallyRon @Nigel_Farage It’s racist - and simply wrong in law - to assume asylum seekers are illegal immigrants.  They’re not.
Who the hell is running our country? The left have taken over our media, the immigration department has gone to sea, looks like the left are going to manage to extend the transition period. We voted for a government to stop this and even with a 80 majority and it's just as bad.

@LeaveEUOfficial Enough! France is being paid millions to police these illegals.By all means let them come ashore, then put them straight back on a ferry back to France where the “selection “ process should happen. Once they realise it’s a quick turn round, the traffickers will be hardest hit.

@lisanandy We didn't welcome them, we refused to allow their parents asylum, but I think our current attitude to migrants is ugly. When I needed a neighbour is sung in schools and forgotten by the adults.

@Andywelsh777 @JohnRentoul @hendopolis Legitimate migrants tend to make visa applications and arrive by Eurotunnel or airplane.You think people risking it in a dinghy via criminal gangs have a "legitimate reason" to come from France that way?Pull the other one.
@monkey_grinder @AphexGwyn @Elizabe68465042 @Biglarry2k11 @NicolaSturgeon It amazes me how so many nationalists are as naive to think that the hundreds of illegal immigrants pouring into Dover every day are genuine asylum seekers.

British Migrant Detention camps in Moldova, Morocco and PNG? This sounds like the penal colonies all over again. I guess when the Conservatives talk of "Australian style immigration" they only meant the truly disgraceful bits. Not racist at all though appaz.

Britain's elaborate &amp; expensive (for the taxpayer) asylum system is pretty pointless. Because even if claims are rejected, their own countries won't take them back. (Radio 4 "Today".) So some 40,000 failed asylum seekers are still here. (I'd've thought more.) So scrap the system!

@mikegalsworthy Sounds crazy but reality is, if migrants are proved illegal and refused asylum in the country, as we all know, a  whole set of new issues occur.
@dem_cath To mention Nazis in this context is inflammatory &amp; absurd - sorry !  Asylum seekers will be properly &amp; decently accommodated whilst their asylum status is ‘processed’. Coz of Covid can’t be done here without local residents feeling threatened/angry
Why does Nick Robinson adopt that jocular tone when reading out reports of Tory / fascist ideas for asylum seeker prison camps on islands and old ships? It might please his political string pullers but it is inappropriate and demeans the BBC. #R4Today
@robertrotifer @panchoballard @bbcnickrobinson Are they seriously going to use precious military airlift capacity to relocate asylum seekers at vast expense, just to prove how fucking hard they are? Makes me sick. Our Home Secretary is a thick pillock, and I don’t care how rich she is. She can’t sing, either.
@HarryCobeans @sazmeister88 @pritipatel Strange that you love the EU so much and just don’t think it’s a good enough place for asylum seekers. How much progress have you made towards leaving the country you hate so much, btw?
@devonlass @0KF4NT4ST1C @BrookerA69 @TimM33 @PickardJE Some chap called me a racist for saying that I thought the UK did enough in comparison to other countries with asylum seekers. Bizarre
@sciguyryan @tconnellyRTE @IanDunt @rtenews revoke your UK citizenship and nob off then.
@mrjamesob It should be a big story: focused on how immoral this country’s treatment of refugees and asylum seekers is.
@theousherwood @LBC If they want, @pritipatel and @10DowningStreet government may relocate, deport anywhere, Assencion looks really nice, beaches warm and away from most morally, financially corrupt government! If this was Sierra Leone, they'd sanction and ask @EmmanuelMacron to send in the troops
We should also start taking in a fair share of asylum seekers and stop creating the conditions that cause them. I'm sure many of them would rather stay in their homes but countries like the UK have made their homes too dangerous to live in. https://t.co/fggR78YL1n
@BoerboelUK The idea could actually become a deterrent, if as an illegal immigrant you know that you will be shipped there for processing, these freeloaders might have second thoughts. The gimmegrunts are already complaining about Army barracks accommodation.
@bbcnews You should make the point that #Germany has four times the number of #asylum seekers, #France three times the number and #Spain twice as many. Even little #Greece gets twice the number. Stop making the UK a victim.
@tconnellyRTE @IanDunt @rtenews Good. The UK Government needs a slap since if they can break the law, so can anyone else.Sincerely, a British citizen who no longer considers themselves to be British.
@duncspenc @theousherwood It’s all playing with right wing people. Patel planning concentration camps a long way away. Has she ever met an asylum seeker?
The U.K. government can honestly get to fuck. They won’t rule out the idea of sending asylum seekers to Scottish islands for processing? Sounds an awful lot like they plan on keeping them in camps. https://t.co/sYKWKCBzzt

@SueWhitaker11 Illegal migrants .asylum seekers apply in the first safe country .most of these are just chancers illegal migrants who throw away all papers ids etc .
@LeanneWood They are not asylum seekers as they have come from a safe country, they are illegal immigrants as they have contravened immigration laws. Genuine asylum seekers should be treated as such, but these law breakers should be incarcerated until processed.
@armdpm @thetimes @NicolaSturgeon the illegals would not relish the thought of kipping in the back of those rusting hulks, so ideal.

Yes &amp; also it has the intent of normalising, even neutralising, the existing cruelty in the system.

@PeterStefanovi2 But we got sovereignty, we can make our own stuff, we won't have those foreigner EU types tell us what to do. And we love being out or work unable to live, work or retire in 27 other countries and bowing our heads to money grabbing self centered Tories who ar better than us.
@leedsbeatles @iRacing74 @PickardJE @GeorgeWParker @pmdfoster They're not being processed as asylum seekers. They're illegal migrants who when found are detained &amp; deported. They're shipped here by organised criminal gangs. They don't arrive on a train, ferry or aircraft &amp; claim asylum yet you conflate both together.
@ScotNational How long before the UK cage children, and enforce sterilisation of women immigrants ?
@DPJHodges immigration, mostly of young men making their way from France to get over here. Most of them wouldn't be eligible for asylum and there are far fewer numbers of women &amp; children coming over. On top of that, encouraging it results in many deaths in the crossings.
@JeremyVineOn5 I would prefer that the asylum swindlers (sic) were denied entry in to the UK in the first place, however I'd rather they be confined to ferries than free to roam around the streets of our land. #JeremyVine
@mc_grath6 @b_leeder @GemmaTognini @MarkMcGowanMP Obiter from later cases (Nationwide News) said that there might be (unspecified) conditions where "absolute" would be modified by need, but I don't think that this instance is that.

@faeristar @BorisJohnson @michaelgove @Nigel_Farage That c**t Farage will carry on down his racist rabbit hole and no doubt cause the Tories more problems unless they swap Johnson for Patel and she gets to deport all the refugees and asylum seekers to some hellhole.
You don't have to seek asylum in the first safe country you reach. That's garbage.
@changed_gear It’s the innate xenophobia of many Brits that condemns us all to years of tory rule. They use xenophobic rhetoric to win votes, people are stupid enough to fall for it.
@Hamptondener @YouGov They just want to demonstrate how much they hate immigrants, despite us  being unable to run our society properly without migrant labour. Red meat to their base to distract them from all the excess death on their hands. #Ascension https://t.co/OmBppWHXUH
@mrjamesob I know that in general since recetion 2009 the uk has had a lot less migration from Africa i can’t even have my mum visit us which is heartbreaking . I think the hostile environment policy has effected how many asylum seeker are in the uk . It’s kind of shameful

I represented a Syrian refugee this week who escaped on a lorry as a 15 year old. Says ISIS were torturing, killing + maiming people. No parents.Now a college student in the UK with his own room and trying to live his life. Very brave young man. Felt teary dealing with his case
The State has a right not to issue one with a Passport even to withdraw citizenship. British born jihadists who went to join ISIS in Syria are now stateless after the UK government withdrew British passports. So a passport is not an inalienable human right. You are wrong. https://t.co/k9YWNJZfqe
Why is the government trying to innovate new ways of being cruel to migrants? Utterly demented. https://t.co/u9ecww6JvF

“Offshore processing” of asylum claims is driven by racism + xenophobia alone. When Trump suggested similar in the US, there was outcry. Now, the BBC calmly questions if it’s workable? This an effective way to drag policy to the right...1/?
Makes sense. What's the betting they'll be straight back in the water to UK unless secured, then be accused of draconian measures NB No children/women. Shall hazard guess that the people shouting re treatment of ILLEGAL immigrants aren't using the services being swamped! https://t.co/5VpU08fsVD
Just because the offshore asylum proposal is a different bad thing to the one you were just talking about does not make it a “dead cat”. This government is capable of being sincerely bad on multiple fronts and opposing one does not excuse another. Also, killing cats is itself bad

@changed_gear This is what many, many people believe - but they only are against it when it's "other people".If they moved abroad, they'd be expats.And it is pure racism, as they only see a 'foreigner' by the colour of their skin.
@PrinceOfPartys @TPointUK You can not seek asylum from a safe country such as France. But that doesn’t fit your lefty dogma does it?

@TPointUK They should be in detention centres until their asylum claims are processed, not in hotels free to come and go as they wish. A floating detention centre is a great idea. A real asylum seeker would not object if it meant they were safe.

@talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 @BellaSankey @DetentionAction Article 31 of the UN Convention on Refugees is quite clear - they are illegal entrants.  The illegality is ignored if they turn out to have a right to refuge.  It is not illegal to claim asylum.  It is illegal to enter without authorisation.

@JudeCosgrove @chuffy13579 @AyoCaesar Economic misery doesn’t qualify you refugee status, being poor  is not a qualification for refugee status, people seem to forget this, that is economic migration.
@AyoCaesar Land-based asylum centres are prisons too. But, surely, having committed the crime of coming here illegally, there's some sense in it, isn't there?What are the alternatives? Reward human traffickers by providing a free-for-all? Or zero tolerance / send them all back?

@pritipatel’s suggestion of detaining asylum-seekers on Ascension Island is horrific. They are already treated appallingly in our asylum system &amp; this would cut them off completely. The Australian system has been exposed as inhumane. Why would we copy such shameful ill-treatment?

@calibrax @darrengrimes_ Just checked the stats actually those were asylum application numbers, we also have fewer refugees than Sweden, Italy and Austria. We really need to get a backbone and stop being such snowflakes about this. We didn't build the British Empire by being afraid of foreigners.

@rymer_joe @talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 @BellaSankey @DetentionAction There are still major wars going on right now in Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria. They've killed over 30,000 people combined just this year. So if someone from one of those countries wants to seek asylum here, they're unfortunately in the same position as those Belgians were

@talkRADIO @JuliaHB1 @BellaSankey @DetentionAction 1914  refugees?! Bit of a difference, the German Army were sweeping into their country! Actually agree with her on right to claim asylum, so why not do it in , eg at € ️ terminal or  Embassy? No need then for dangerous  x-ing or  detentions.

@dianepar @botanic_my @QuislingT You’re welcome. The reason I’m sceptical is that to require a visa means effectively denying your citizenship which requires jumping through major legal hoops.

Priti Patel’s parents were not asylum seekers, nor refugees. They were immigrants who came to UK to run their businesses and make money.

Prison ships have been used before, initially a couple of centuries ago, they were called "a voyage to nowhere" ships, possibly for Thatchers "citizens of nowhere".

@calibrax @darrengrimes_ Maybe you're not afraid of foreigners, but the UKIP types definitely are. We do help our own people first, at the same time we have to deal with asylum seekers. The alternative is ignoring them &amp; letting them do what they want unmonitored. Which is what used to happen pre-C20th.

@Otto_English The fundamental problem is that the HO is useless. Too slow and its decisions are routinely overturned. To place asylum seekers ‘out of sight and mind’ is to deny them access to the law and to charity sector support. It’s heinous.

@petertimmins3 Asylum seekers and economic migrants are not criminals, yet they are to be locked up in concentration camps.
I wonder why the government is tossing out random, impractical ideas about how to manage a relatively small number of people seeking asylum? Could it be to distract us from the shit storm that is its handling of #Covid19UK  or the looming disaster that is #Brexit?
@DMinghella US politicians demonised migrants &amp; rallied around "build the wall" (which they had no intention of doing)But UK already has a 20 mile moat &amp; totally ignores most migrants arrive by plane, ferry.The same playbook. Creating a media fueled distraction from GMT shenanigans.

@GTLynes1 @SebastianEPayne I think current logistics for illegal immigrants are quite costly. But more importantly are ineffectual - it's difficult to deport them.
@stand_for_all @AdamHollowayMP What happens to people that makes them see arriving 'pocket-clean' in a strange (hostile) land as an 'easy option' &amp; a life choice, &amp; not desperation?Asylum seekers are not 'relativly rich', they are in hoc to thugs &amp; crooks.Rich people get on planes, with tickets.#r4today

Jesus wept. This is surely the result of how 'asylum seekers' have been dehumanised for decades.

We are often kind to individuals, horrific towards groups. https://t.co/Tzvn3xC5AB

That is ludicrously emotive language Sturgeon. Asylum seekers have to be held somewhere while being processed. Suppose you would favour a luxury hotel before they move to their public funded home and full benefits, including our NHS, which really could do with more pressure. https://t.co/bSyA7ldAqo

Rather than "breaking the idea" UK is safe @AdamHollowayMP, let's break idea asylum seekers are a threat or only making journeys because the UK is rich? There multiple reasons people may end up seeking asylum in UK and they need to be supported not villified for that. #r4today 3/
@350 @parents4future Do they though? Just like investors, FF workers have made a conscious decision to take a well paid job that they KNEW was killing the planet.So tell me, why exactly do they deserve a better life than a Rohinga refugee?
Why do asylum seekers need holding offshore? There must be plenty of empty housing after @Conservatives let 50K people die from #COVID19 . #r4today
#r4today I don't think we should be taking immigration advice from an Australian bigot who refers to asylum seekers as "these people".It's a proven fact that deterrents and brutal border enforcement policies don't prevent ppl migrating. They simply make their journeys harder.
Sad reflection on the UK that there is so much xenophobic focus on imprisoning people on ferry hulks. We are pathetically bottom of the European league for refugee acceptance #moreorless. We should be fixing the process for those already here. Ask Mercy Baguma’s family #r4today

@JanetMcwee @NicolaSturgeon I hope you take a step back, take a deep breath and regret that comment.It's not anyone individuals responsibility to help asylum seekers. It's our responsibility as a humane civil society.It's attitudes like this that turner Jews away in the 30's.
Did not realise you were a Tory. But this asylum seeker island idea must be challenged. The UK  in the past has always helped Refugees  and asylum seekers. No10 xenophobic strategy is vile. As you say we all Human beings on this earth. Kindness is King. https://t.co/Cg10nYcxa4

@AphexGwyn @Elizabe68465042 @Biglarry2k11 @NicolaSturgeon It amazes me how many people with a union flag in their Twitter name get confused and think think that illegal immigrants and asylum seekers are the same thing. Must be the racism addling their brains...
@thetimes They haven't a problem with boats have they... A lot of people will agree with this especially seeing what is happening in Sweden with all the gang rapes. No good letting every illegal migrant into a country without back ground checks, Sweden has proved this.

Well, I would be worried by anyone who wasn't bothered about a bunch of illegal migrants roaming around the UK undocumented
@JeremyCordite Surely better than a tent in France, and as they travelled through Europe to get here they will never gain asylum
@PrisonPlanet Globalists will prioritise maintaining an open border and killing people over closing borders to protect citizens. Same applies to the limitless mass migration of non Western populations into the West.Imagine my shock!

@BoningMugger @PrinceOfPartys @TPointUK Seeking asylum and qualifying for asylum are two different things... most of these 'asylum seekers' do not qualify for asylum.

@WalesPolitics Typical BBC nonsense description as asylum seekers. Legitimate asylum seekers would apply in the first safe country. They have crossed a whole peaceful continent. These people have supposedly left war torn countries, arrive here illegally and then complain about accomodation. 
Still thinking about @bbcr4today’s attitude to the government’s kite flying on interning asylum seekers. Imagine them reporting in the Wansee Conference. “We can’t just shoot all the Jews. Would it be better to gas them instead?”
Should I also point this wave is the result of our xenophobia towards migrants or is that too soon?We should be angry that cases are rising again, but be honest, similar numbers been charting in the last two months but we didn't give a shit because coded 'BWN'.

@MedellinBlue Well you can’t, I wouldn’t be able to study and live abroad either if I was illegal. You can only be deported if you’re illegal and by illegal I mean not seeking for official documents or asylum depending on your case. And you get no type of reward by doing so

Deplorable.
@RiachJoan @NicolaSturgeon your words sadly prove my point , when your government are complicit 8n making people require asylum , the economic unsibulity from countyrs raped by the British empire , but yet you would deny them ?
@roccogalatilaw Police in Quebec now allowed to enter your home if it is found you have any visitors. IN YOUR OWN HOME. 1,000 fine. They can do this, but cannot stop the flow of illegals coming in daily from ROXHAM ROAD! POLICE CAN NOW ENTER YOUR HOME IF YOU HAVE VISITORS. Think about this
The use of "migrant" in this sentence involves a telling presumption of guilt and dehumanisation.  "Illegal immigration" here is any asylum application which might conceivably turn out to fail at a latter date though.  Ergo, ALL REFUGEES ARE ILLEGAL MIGRANTS. https://t.co/2uU2fZKjtw

@calibrax @darrengrimes_ UK receives relatively few asylum seekers compared with other major EU countries, so the central thesis is garbage. It’s just that we have more morons in this country who prefer to blame a few dinghies for their grievances rather than the idiots they keep voting for

@BoningMugger @AttilaTheCnuT @TPointUK From the UK refugee council:There is no such thing as an ‘illegal’ or ‘bogus’ asylum seeker. Under international law, anyone has the right to apply for asylum in any country that has signed the 1951 Convention and to remain there until the authorities have assessed their claim.

@sonofr The asylum policy (if you could call it a policy) has been self defeating for years.It's just getting more racist.These people are here, and will stay.Get used to it, and give them a chance to work, pay taxes and integrate with the rest of us.The current 'policy' is wasteful.
@RHenderson91 @MrHarryCole No, I don't wonder at all. This disgraceful situation has been ongoing far longer than the so-called epidemic. The flood of illegal immigrants must be stopped forthwith and then reversed. Deport all illegal entrants, regardless of status, who have entered the UK in last 10 years
@MattHancock has really emerged during this crisis as a deeply dishonest &amp; petulant man to boot, he is however a cronies dream channelling jobs &amp; contracts to the unqualified &amp; undeserving! https://t.co/7FACACYv4V
Lots of people on FB responding with "deport them", "send them back." Trouble with those comments is that the offender's and victims were all non-British nationals. Where does vengeance and xenophobia begin and compassion end? Reactionary ideas can have unintended consequences. https://t.co/y4mYlV1zp0
@KresySiberia @db_webb @AdamHollowayMP It was in the context of asylum centres though.
Once we were the country that blocked European Jewish refugees from coming here, including the families of the Kindertransport kids. And we put those we did admit into internment camps because the Mail called them a threat. The UK has always been a nation of spiteful xenophobes. https://t.co/Ez0qjm5VHo
@LFC_blano My blood is boiling.  How many of our own are sleeping rough on the streets, whilst this ungrateful lot of illegals have roofs over their heads &amp; are being fed &amp; watered? They're nothing more than economic migrants on the take. If the freebies aren't good enough, feck off home. https://t.co/r7nk3IYD71

Migrants die daily while trying to cross European and North American borders. For many, the right to apply for asylum is ignored and they are pushed back and trapped for years in violence and poverty. It is time to put an end to racist and murderous immigration policies.

@nahaltoosi The Trump Doctrine is going to continue to bring peace throughout the world and then it will no longer be necessary for anyone to seek asylum or be a refugee.
Offshore holding camps? The very idea is an abuse of human dignity, and a denial of human rights. Every human being has a right to belong to humanity. Why plan to house asylum seekers on ferries is Home Office's dumbest idea yet https://t.co/QqDw8RD7rv

@mrjamesob That's simply because people like you conflate genuine refugees and asylum seekers with illegal migrants, of which ALL those crossing from France are the latter.
@ActsofFaithblog @JillFilipovic I’m not debating the merits of Rep. Omar with you. All of us were lucky to come here. That kind of anti-refugee rhetoric is despicable from anyone, but especially a president. A decent person could be critical of her policies or statements without claiming this isn’t her country.
@RichardRose01 @toryboypierce They are hardly desperate, they've probably travelled up through some of the richest and safest nations on earth anyone one of which they could have claimed asylum.

@crispiandjb So if every single stopped migrant, due to lack of integration and a fair job, would’ve start selling smuggled butt, at a pace of 20 pack per day in one year the amount of smuggled fags would’ve been 1 billion. 1 billion. 1 billion. You hypocrite!

@PatriotHans @WaistlessaxeXb1 @ketchupsupreme @TomiLahren are just claiming asylum when they get caught. Trump has blocked migrants who don’t apply for asylum before reaching the border, which goes against our asylum law.
@LifeOfCorf @Hannahxgalloway @19AndSix @tomcoe @BritainElects @SavantaComRes Don't even try and pedal the socialist angle on this, because your lot would have had ferries running for the illegals by now, the problem would have been exponentially worse!

@DarkMatter2525 He's right though. If you're an illegal immigrant and you have no legitimate justification to seek asylum, you'd have to be an idiot to show up to a court date.
@cushbomb Also Trump said desperate asylum seekers had low-IQs. So... worse than Biden I’d say!
@Bo_Collins3 The answer is yes. But let me say your whole argument is flawed. Ironically the guy you’re voting for made lots of money exploiting illegals. Illegals have been a huge part of the economy for decades. It’s not as though they just arrived.

@Cheesygatsby @SkyNews I’m aware. But speak to the average immigration antagonist and they don’t care how they arrive, illegally or legally; simply they are not wanted. Let’s be very clear, Parochialism, nationalism and xenophobia is what drives this agenda. Hence disdain of the EUs FOM.

@BBCNews Cue people in the comments still insisting they’re all economic illegal immigrants and are being put up in 5* hotels because The Scum and Wail told them so. + of course the bunch that don’t understand that, no, they don’t have to claim asylum at the first safe country.
@SBMcCallister @MaryLTrump You point out the idea I had when Trimp gave details about what captive bound women look like, &amp; the way he talks about human trafficking, &amp; how much he projects things. I think Trimp is involved in the illegal sex trade. Bigly. My theory at this point.

@petersavodnik I’ve read there’s a suspicion that some cases are related to human trafficking (people taking these poor kids along and then dumping them), but the cruel bureaucracy of immigration, legal or illegal, is the main culprit. It’s Kafkaesque in the best case.

@melaniepowell20 @JonesCitizen Fuck asylum seekers
@Pupats @KBGreyhoundlady @JolyonMaugham Why should it?Once the UK has a border with the EU, the government has the ability to properly strengthen that border. Genuine asylum seekers can enter via the border by claiming asylum. We should deport migrants who illegally enter the UK, as they have already broken the law.
Trump claiming to be the least racist  person in the room is like a Tory saying they are compassionate whilst voting against free meals for the poor and not protecting unaccompanied migrant children
Come on England, do you see the mendacious actions of this Government? They voted not to feed your most disadvantaged children!!  IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC!!! While at the same time lining the pockets of their pals! Surely no decent Citizen can vote for these chancers!
@LadBonnie The mere fact she paid a people trafficker to get to the UK annuls any claim to be an asylum seeker. She is an illegal economic migrant.

@WestonJK @JMDelga82664720 @KellyannePolls Exactly, it's what something is used for after it's made that makes it evil. Building a holding facility for illegals whilst they await court hearings, is DIFFERENT from shoving children, removed from their parents &amp; left to die of flu because they are UNATTENDED &amp; uncared for.
Holy sh*t she really just said that traumatizing children for life and potentially never letting them see their parents again is an acceptable punishment for people fleeing death and destitution in their home country without a visa. https://t.co/rYAbZDBxbV
Good! No foreigner should get to commit crimes in the UK and think they have a right to remain here.We should also stop them from getting Legal Aid to appeal against deportation after being found guilty by a court. This should also apply to failed asylum claims. https://t.co/Vg9ramgs2n

It’s very interesting that he always mentions “murderers and rapists” when talking about undocumented immigrants. #Debates2020
Trump repeats the murder/rapist claim about asylum seekers. Only the stupid ones show up for hearings.
Wow, we’re back to immigrants and asylum seekers as “murderers and rapists... those with the lowest IQ.” The xenophobia is so incredibly strong, tonight.
How do you seek asylum in another country?! Sir that is a refugee

Immigration Facts: It's international law that you can seek asylum at any of a country's ports of entry. You don't need to apply in your home country for asylum.

Omg did he really call Immigrants seeking asylum have low IQ?
Oh my god, Trump just said that only undocumented migrants with a “reeeeeeeeally low IQ” would show up to their court case
"only people with the lowest IQ came back" what the absolute fuck. These people were applying for asylum. They came back the overwhelming majority of the time to argue their cases for asylum.
Trump is still calling asylum seekers "murders and rapists".
Did he just say he was going to give citizenship to all undocumented migrants? Whoa! That’ll go down like a turd on a tea table with Americans. #Debate2020 #basementJoe #warpspeed

#Debates2020 illegals should seek asylum before coming to America.

Let’s just insult asylum seekers... #Debates2020

this man calling asylum seekers idiots???
Donald Trump just said that asylum seekers who show up for their court cases have low IQs.FUCK this man. He is not a president.
We have always had of asylum seekers.
I hope certain Australian parliament politicians (well, the majority, let's face it) are listening to Biden talking about how terrible it is that asylum seekers are sent to another country, instead of being able to stay and make their case.
Why is he still referring to asylum seekers as murderers and rapists?
@realDonaldTrump More lies you are feeding the fools that follow you. All people seeking asylum aren't murderers and rapists. #TrumpLies
I see he’s back on labelling asylum seekers as rapists and murderers.The racism is not implied. It’s right out in the open.
Here he goes again, equating immigrants and asylum seekers with murders and rapists and low IQs. This guy is disgusting. Vote him out. #debate2020
Trump just said immigrants who follow the proper steps to receive asylum have a low IQ. What a clown
Many immigrants seek lawyers to plead their asylum case
Referring to immigrants and asylum seekers as murders and rapists again... #Debates2020

trump u say rapists are coming into the country, i was raped by a citizen??? THEYRE ALREADY HERE

Trump back to calling immigrants seeking asylum “rapists &amp; murderers” and then talking about IQs. WOW. When u think there can’t be another low.

#Debates2020 They don't come back because some of these asylum seekers are trying to not be killed. If you send them back and force them to stay there, they are KILLED. so of course they don't come back, because you sentenced them to death
Oh my god Trump is flunking on immigration, in every country in the world, immigrants who are not given asylum will always return to the country they’re trying to get into, its an immigration issue that almost every sovereign state has an issue with #Election2020
Joe assumes you're an idiot by intentionally conflating asylum seeking with illegal immigration
You don't get to critique Obama now. Catch &amp; release is not "horrible." It's patient. And it trusts people. Do you not know? We have a legal obligation to allow asylum seekers to remain in the US while awaiting asylum hearings.YOU are the one who doesn't understand.
He said only low IQ asylum seekers come back for court. I can’t breathe.
You guys, Trump is bringing up his lovely hypothesis that Mexicans are drug dealers and racists because I guess it worked for him in 2015. He also said the ones that show up for their asylum court date “don’t have the highest IQs.” Fuck. Him. #Debates2020
Yep. Biden has been showing empathy for undocumented migrants. Trump insults them. World of difference. https://t.co/IM2WNkxsXL

@chim0m @chadfelixg Yes. If you can go country shopping, you're an immigrant not a refugee or asylum seeker.

“Only those with the lowest IQ would come back.” I genuinely don’t know why the hell people still trust someone who refers to people seeking asylum as not only rapists and, “coyotes,” but also as stupid for coming to a country where we promised to help those in need.

Wow. Trump really just insulted the intelligence of asylum-seekers who make an effort to comply with the law.
@realDonaldTrump equates asylum seekers to murderers, rapists and very bad people. Such a shame that the rhetoric in #PresidentialDebate2020 stoops so low.
Trump just said the very few people that show up to their asylum hearings are "sadly, very low I.Q."
Trump’s border policy has turned asylum seekers into sitting ducks for gangs. Here’s one example. It was very painful to meet this father and his traumatized child. Vital to tell their story.  https://t.co/2GTOXApvAl
I. Can. NOT. Trump is a racist bigot and is not doing anything to help the African American community. He insights and applauds racism and xenophobia!
Did Donald Trump really just call the Mexican asylum seekers stupid???
@LBC First slip up by Trump, saying only "Low IQ" asylum seekers turn up for a hearing if released into the USA. 
The low IQ illegals would have stolen it first. https://t.co/crCuQXfCo1
By saying that people crossing the border could be murderers or rapist is promoting racism and xenophobia.
@mcdowellformo @realDonaldTrump But I have heard that once those immigrants enter the US for asylum and get a court date. They don’t show up for the asylum date.
@confessedsinner I totally understand. The stories I heard deeply touched me. I was mostly working with asylum seekers whose families were murdered by gangs in El Salvador and then were locked up in facilities here. The stuff I heard I will never forget.

Did he just say “catch and release” like asylum seekers are fucking animals?
Bring the people dying from #EndSARS to AmericaThey are refugees. They are legit asylum seekers.That's how the laws are written. People dying from a genocide are allowed. Not just anyone who comes from bad living conditions
the fact that trump thinks that people seeking asylum are automatically rapists, murderers, and gang members just SHOWS that he is racist

@CZEdwards and what is their path to citizenship? Does he just keep them in detention until they are old enough to deport?
@TomiLahren It’s not illegal to seek asylum Tommy
Trump just said if you are honorable and are coming to America seeking asylum due to legitimate need and show up for your court date you must have low IQ.
The people who come back to make their case for asylum have a low IQ.So everyone who doesn't do it right are smart but rapists. The ones who do do it right have a low IQ.This is our president.
To be clear there's no context in which using that slur is appropriate but he specifically was going to use it to describe asylum seekers who actually show up to their court hearings (and then doubled-back and still was an ableist racist piece of crap)
So if you come to America seeking asylum and show up for your court date you’re a low IQ individual? You would think @realDonaldTrump would love them because he loves the uneducated.  #Debates2020
@KnicksChamps21 @ManNOrange @KyleKulinski undocumented immigrants pay more in state and local taxes than billionaires pay in federal taxes
The fact that Tr**p still calls immigrants seeking asylum rapists and murderers...  #VoteHimOut
@Official_Kalisz @MarenMorris @TomiLahren It's not illegal to seek asylum. That IS the "right way." Also, fuck you.
Trump blaming catch and release for lawlessness then calling denied asylum seekers “those with the lowest IQs” for returning to their court dates for deportation is not only  but also makes clear what he would do if he were in their shoes. #immigrantsarenotcriminals
@jonfavs No, I went back.  It was g’head.  His comment about the lowest iq asylum seekers is what we should be focused on.  That and all the lies.
Wow, did @realDonaldTrump just say that asylum seekers who turn up to their court dates have low IQs for doing so? That shows how he thinks and what a crook he is #Debates2020
@FiveThirtyEight Given that this implies that at least 5% of men want both all undocumented immigrants deported AND to have a path to citizenship, I'm not sure it's a very useful poll.
DISGUSTING https://t.co/0F0PW0X6VI
@NorissaSEP Obama was "the deporter in Chief". Now we're told Biden is a friend of the undocumented immigrant! What a farce.
THIS man is brilliant, probably ten times the IQ score that Trump has. Fuck him and saying that immigrants are not smart. My father is 100% self made, I’ve had a wonderful career in the Is because of my parents sacrifice and support. They went to all of their court dates. https://t.co/HTo7m3tRz4
@JoyVBehar Consider the danger of housing the young with the adults.  This would not be an issue if the illegals were turned away at the borders when they dont have proper documentation
@Amy_Siskind He's confusing the undesirable asylum seekers who sneak away with the low IQ seekers who stupidly show up? So...which ones are the rapists? (They're always rapists.)
@MattBarnaby3636 Also, stealing Brown kids and putting them in cages for **years** to terrorize asylum seekers? So last cycle.

Trump said “the people who go to their hearings are really re- I hate to say this, they’re really low iq” He almost said retarded and stopped himself. He thinks migrants and asylum seekers who follow the law are developmentally delayed.  #Debates2020
@miguelevision “They should just do it legally!”*Shows up to asylum hearing*“OMG your so dumb!” 
@grayskymornin @CNBC Well it's a critique on the process. You'd be a fool to show up because you'd likely be sent back. Otherwise, the resources involved, asylum cities, etc. make it extremely challenging to locate, round up and send back.
Trump called asylum seekers that come back for their hearings low iq 
Remember these scumbags saying they would lower immigration &amp; stop illegal crossings?Well here they are boasting about a possible 3,000,000 new immigrants who wont need any job or skills to be acceptedIf you think house prices/unemployment/etc are bad now just wait... https://t.co/Rfuu1tntf5

He called people who return for their court date, thus following the law, to make their case for asylum “the lowest IQ.” Absolutely despicable https://t.co/S2csno8INL
legal immigration is cool and all except when u realise that the easiest option to get citizenship is to get a company to sponsor u and pay u jack shit for 12 years, and then giving the company the option of deporting u the second they don’t wanna sponsor u anymore
Yes he did!! Everyone just skipped over the fact he called immigrants seeking asylum and trying to follow the law (65% not 1% he claimed) basically idiots https://t.co/FbPwS9HnAr
@HenryJKraven She should've muted his comments about the migrant kids' parents dropping them off like "coyotes!"
I’m packing my shit luckily I have a citizen ship I Ireland and Scotland
Trump says only asylum seekers with a "low IQ" show up at court. Well, according to the Transactional Records Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, 99% of non-detained asylum seekers attended their hearings in 2019. Maybe Trump has a low IQ for not knowing seeking asylum is legal

@AGutiGarcia @TheLaurenChen You don’t have to deport them all at once. You make it illegal to hire them with prison time as the punishment. It will get a lot harder for them to find jobs and they’ll start to leave.

The “least racist person in the room” used a slur in reference to refugees and asylum seekers twice in this debate
“I’m the least racist person in the room” -Trump literally minutes after implying the only asylum seekers that aren’t murderers and rapists are people with low IQs
He reduced asylum seekers to rapists, murderers and those with low iq. He gave no other category. https://t.co/mBwsA3XvF4
seeking asylum shouldnt be illegal https://t.co/ptPhhLlY47
@Zigurat777 @JoeBiden so to what you're saying  this is human trafficking? keeping innocent kids away from families is for what? sexual exploitation? he's just taking away human rights at this point. america can't be the land of the free without everyone free.
@hilaryluros He described asylum seekers who showed up for a hearing to be incredibly stupid. He is so racist. Joe should be taking him to task.
Trump: people seeking asylum are rapists and criminals *5 minutes later* I’m the least racist person
Trump: Only those with the lowest IQ would come back for their hearing (immigrants seeking asylum).
His comments about immigrants/asylum seekers? You have to be absolutely kidding me. He simply doesn’t care anymore. That’s all.
@LabyrinthWeaver I couldn't watch that part. In our country the government has consistently demonised people seeking asylum since 2000 in a similar way. Simply put, it's a vote winner dressed up as patriotism. Disgusting.
@johnmyers @ryeisenberg Because he thinks that every law abiding citizen is a sucker and a fool. It’s appalling.
Trump: I'm probably the least racist person in this room. Also Trump: Undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers who showed up to their immigration hearings probably have very low IQs.

@SpectatorUSA @afneil @JoeBiden @KateAndrs Citizenship for 11 million plus illegal immigrants? No deportations? Banning or not of fracking? Ending the oil industry? A dark winter would be coming....
@kenklippenstein To be honest it makes sense, Trump's thing was that he always wanted to deport more ppl than Obama. But the deporter in Chief couldn't be beaten
It is sad that people cannot have political differences and not get death threats. If you sent me a death threat I hope it made you so happy telling me that you hope an illegal immigrant  rapes me then kill my family. I hope you all have a good night and stay safe.
@1K_47 Not on asylum seekers , just illegal crossers , they gave asylum seekers court dates
@BriannaWu ...but only the undocumented people who show up to court and respect the law! Because that’s apparently what Trump considers a sign of low intelligence.
Trump really said asylum seekers that want to abide by US law and show up to court are idiots. So embarrassing. #PresidentialDebate2020 #TrumpIsNotAmerica
I'm also appalled by family separation at the border, however, when Trump said "coyote" he meant the very well known slang term for human traffickers at the Mexican border, not actual coyotes. I only mention this because it's trending and some of you will feel silly tomorrow
Remember when the president said that only the immigrants with low IQs show up to their court date when seeking asylum?
He is racist!!!!! Those are the same people that are feeding Americans! Be respectful https://t.co/fkBfwwAC9f
@courtdanee2 Coyotes are people who are paid by illegals to smuggle them across the border.
@danielle_priest I thought it was racist to tell a migrant to go home, or does that depend on the colour of their skin, which again, I thought was racist? Bit of a hypocrite really aren't you?Also I was brought here, as a child migrant, so f*ck off 
@SDePace Biden said that never before people had to see asylum in a foreign country. Lie!I came here in 1989 from the Soviet Union, and we spent 9 months in Italy waiting to get admission as political refugees. Partly the wait was due to them granting only some of your fam admission.

According to Trump, there are two types of asylum seekers: 1. Criminals (murders, rapist and gangsters) and 2. Those with really low IQ.  I believe it is convenient for him to think of people this way so he feels justified in his actions. Such a man doesn't have time for empathy.

The vast majority of migrants being caught crossing the border were families seeking asylum, not murderers or rapists. Many released into the U.S. did not return for their court hearings, but previous administrations
I want to go to brighton asylum but my friends be to scaryy
@EliseViksaas @EWErickson If you say that is true which it is not..how come they have not come back for these kids..these kids were used by illegals come in the US &amp; were not their parents..your hate of Trump makes you lose all mental capacity..
@castlvillageman Yeah but the man in question was a Foreigner and soon there won’t be any more of those in England so obviously there won’t be any need for those silly cross-border cooperation thingies, what?
@_Jason_Dean_ @josh_posts To be fair, he was saying that asylum seekers trying to follow the law are stupid, and the ones breaking the law are smart. Because Trump hates legal immigrant and loves illegal immigrants, according to Trump.

@CaesarSofia One example was the less than 1% of immigrants show up for their asylum trials...just complete, utter horseshit
Hypocrite. You encourage illegal immigration by failing to stop people trafficking and cossetting illegals more than our own veterans. That makes you complicit in these and other deaths of illegals in transit. Your virtue signalling is distasteful. @pritipatel #hypocrite https://t.co/GResKWDyxC

@JarodSuttles @JessTessjes @CNN By implication Trump is saying that asylum seekers are either stupid for turning up or criminals for not turning up. That isn't true and is racist.
@marigolds He punched the Wall when he realised Mexico wasn't going to pay for it.
@Mosghos @Kireiiiii3 @flying_rodent I know a Tory who houses asylum seekers who've lost recourse to public funds in their house. I think he's a firm believer in people people looking out for each other.But, on the other hand, he's a raging homophobe and was fined for breaching a buffer zone at an abortion clinic.
@___ThatGuyJay @generalk5811 @JCThinksOutloud @realDonaldTrump If an illegal immigrant, probably less educated, less trained and potentially not speaking English, is coming over and taking a job which you would be willing to do then I think the problem is with you not them!

@NeverGi15643735 @benshapiro Where does that profit come from? There is no demand for child labour in the US, except in a few specific area like child sex trafficking, so you can maybe see how "coyote" becomes defamatory if you apply it generally to migrant parents.
@GoatSarah Dear EU. Make us all get a fuckin' visa for each and every trip. Maybe not the Scots....
@OctaviaGreymane @DanielBoffey UK travellers will suck it up. People were still going to USA despite visa requirements and long queues. However loss of freedom of movement has actual serious implications for high skilled Brits in the EU even despite the withdrawal agreement

@cjtruth And sometimes that payment is changed halfway through the journey because the coyote knows if the migrant is dropped off in middle of nowhere, they will likely die. Many are raped, killed, left to die, and extorted for more money.
@Upyourjunker1 About time we cleared our streets. We need to deport the ones clogging up hotels and council houses then home our veterans
First they ripped children from parents and put them in cages. Now they’ve “lost” those parents, now they’re performing forced sterilizations, now they’re torturing asylum seekers into signing their own deportation papers. How many human rights abuses will ICE get away with?

@BreitbartLondon Deport the family and extended families to an Islamic country that will take them. They need to realise where they're living. Zero tolerance.
@Upyourjunker1 Labour want to turn the country into a giant asylum
@thehill Well, let's ask them to narrow that down.Do they mean the parents they can't even find to ask, or the parents who are living in such danger in their home countries, they're afraid their children will be killed, which is why they were seeking asylum in the first place?
@thatmonokid @YouGov Race is irrelevant, go to any EU country &amp; sleep rough on the streets, upon finding you're a 'foreign National,' you'll be sent home. There are laws, foreigners breaking them shouldn't get a free pass by screaming racism.

@ValObikwere @SecondWinston @Robert37992421 @MichealMoon19 @tariqnasheed No, poor Africans do not come here like that unless asylum seekers. First, they couldn't afford to come here. It is like a homeless person from USA trying to go to UK. The ones that come to USA are most times elite, and come from $$$ already and can live very well back home.

@monkeyrealms @akarlin88 There is no need to confirm the language skills in case inheriting citizenship from parents.But regular adult immigrants must confirm language proficiency

@alanmayeruk @LFC_blano @pritipatel Totally agree with u al but i think pritti is pulling her hair out, everytime she's introducing a policy the old lefty bastards in the house of Lord's block it,the lefty lawyers stopped her turning illegals around and sending them back,i agree with you but she's being blocked
@OliversArmy123 You are pathetic! When has any politician, of any party, planned to kill migrants and asylum seekers? Utter nonsense.
@trendylefty @Hepworthclare Johnson’s government is a collection of sociopaths and cowards, the issue to crack is how did they persuade so many to prioritise xenophobia and entitlement so give them power And why the opposition parties all were and are so useless.
@DawarHU Personally, I think anyone not accepting the customs of a host nation should be deported and if they are a UK citizen have their right to vote and benefits removed.
@JohnnyMercerUK Just what you need when you’ve screwed over refugee children and English kids who will go without hot meals because of you. What a complete arsehole.
@FuadGashamov @ZMnatsakanyan Yes yes we can see how your ethnic minorities are used as human shields...thrown in the frontline against their will... their remains not returned to families...an axe murderer is an ideal citizen of azerbaijan with blood sucking Aliyevs as their Godfather

@JusttJamesss @MarcDavenant All Romanian asylum seekers who came over on boats!
This, @pritipatel, is outrageous.  These people will send back selfies to those waiting in Calais and encourage them to make the crossing.  Result, more illegals for us to cope with, lots more profit for SERCO. https://t.co/aiwFcnflv0

@MagnumPhotos @McCurryStudios It’s an excellent shot.Whenever I think of Steve McCurry, I recall him discussing his iconic photograph for National Geographic of a girl in a refugee camp in Afghanistan.
@PeterVroom1 @realDonaldTrump They don't care about living people, like children in cages or 8 million more in poverty or millions without health insurance. Certainly open racism and xenophobia are irrelevant to them. Perfect representation of right wing religious nuts.

@swiftiejessie They’re not allowed to work on their visa they’re too old (31) so stupid isn’t it.
@SirTremendous Oh I'm not a 40k fan.But the Latin names, humanocentric xenophobia and fuckhuge cathedrals on ships?
@ColinPeppiatt @piersmorgan @marianmatrisse Well no, because hijacking a ship, unlike claiming asylum, is illegal. Don’t be deliberately mendacious.

@haaretzcom Asylum seekers aka jihadi invaders!
@couiza @DrChrisParry they can be both, but if they're refugees you'd imagine that they'd follow the instructions of the ships master, otherwise any claim for asylum is going to be messed up with a whole bunch of criminal charges.

@aroadinflux @business Exactly, none running from Turkey.  I bet your hands are itching. It must be too hard for you to bear another country uses its resources for its own good. And The Ottoman empire had become the sick man of Europe who were dragged into the war just to create an illegal Israel.

@mnxmoosi @sniff_off @RichForrest2 I absolutely understand.The process was humiliating and a breach of human rights.My point was a response to the “outrage” by the LNP IPA  who have just as equally and painfully, humiliated and breached the human rights of asylum seekers on behalf of Australians.
@LoveHuyton It’s not the migrants fault. The migrants are also children. I agree the government are rats, but I don’t think the anger should be towards migrant people - they are also victims in this corrupt world
@SkyNews Unfortunately the SBS didn't kill the hijackers so they will be applying for asylum, getting benefits, living in a council house and committing a crime near you.
@TodaysComments It was about the us asylum system which is super messed up. That’s why people are pissed.
Nothing ever changed my view on immigration like thinking about how illegal immigrants make the process so long by just cuttin the line. Crazy. I still have the same views that if reforms are made to our system less illegals will come.

@MickeyD44314901 @MailOnline One of the key things that Boris needs to sort out. We can’t have woke/ leftie lawyers blocking legal action and earning a fortune in the process. Illegal immigrants, by definition, have broken the law. Bang to rights. Deport them as quickly as possible.

@nigrugthug @NikkiStix55 @veryfathomer @AcWailing @MichaelYeadon3 It's not as simple as that, Nig. Just like asylum seekers reaching our shores by way of flipper. And, to be certain,  this 2nd wave, if one wants to call it that, the Gov knows what's in store, they're getting ready.  They're determined not to be late for this 2nd  party.

@sabirveryarabb @pill_pilled @SocialistPolls @kesintisizcem They want us to confess a genocide, which never happened, so they can claim, Turkish Republic is an illegal state and they have every right to attack and commit genocide against us themselves.

@DailyMailUK If they can do that why can’t we ban illegals coming across the channel
@DavidBeckler1 MP's are not demonising immigrants. At most there has been a strong push to prevent human trafficking. Much is changing to stop our embodiment of EU racism &amp; isolationism &amp; allow economic immigrants who contribute as much as those before them.
#Govanhill is being protected, the #SNP want to appease the EU &amp; the #SlovakRoma. The landlords of #Pakistani origin have made lots of cash&amp; the abuse of women  continues.The Slovak Roma there sell their women to illegals for sham marriages &amp; widespread prostitution is evident.
@SelaineSaxby Oh so when did you stand up for victims of abuse when Johnson said it was spaffing money up the wall? Or DV victims? Or when he called Muslims letterboxes? Did you stand up then? Or for children? I don’t agree with it but I have zero sympathy for you
@LittleBoats2020 What are all these migrant people for? Why are they being invited to come here? We don’t know what to do with the ones who are here, what are we going to do with the ones  still to come? Why aren’t they being returned to where they came from? What are all these migrants for?

@Mimirocah1 I was in the USNR. We don't do this to terrorists trying to KILL people. Why would we do this to families seeking asylum?
They have received. To hate them is just racism and xenophobia and jealousy. They have done nothing wrong to anyone and don’t deserve the hate they get at all. They are just 7 men living their dream and making music to comfort people. How can you hate that and have a valid+
so you’re saying we had to deal with xenophobia and racism for no fucking reason https://t.co/eETYbWUX5A

@LittleBoats2020 Asylum seekers and refugees are not illegal immigrants.
@JakeWri38029870 @Nigel_Farage They are not illegal migrants. They are asylum seekers.
@LFC_blano @pritipatel, pull your finger out and get these fuckers on a boat back to France.A genuine person, in real need of asylum, would be grateful that they are not being raped, tortured and murdered.These are not victims.

@AdamHopkins1992 @PoliticsPollss Foreign aid is largely about helping people in unstable countries to stay safely in their own homes in various ways instead of having to leave due to war, famine, drought. Pay less foreign aid = get more ‘illegals’ as you so charmingly put it.Sweetheart.
Two very different ways of treating these illegal/economic migrants/asylum seekers.France aggressively dismantling the illegal camps in fields &amp; the Uk provides hotels or Army camps, food &amp; money.Entirely a problem of our own making by a government lacking in political will. https://t.co/mGV6ZuDW99

@MagnificoIX @FormerNewspaper Yes. Moral hazard. This is the same as giving people here illegally amnesty.
@jul1usGB @Nigel_Farage Straight back to where? They are asylum seekers, therefore not illegal. We have every obligation to accept them because we are a signatory to the 1951 UNHCR refugee convention. Fortunately, most people are not bigots like you.

@LSW12612672511 @MailOnline The sea is choppy here today and your mates are complaining its cold so wouldn't head our way looking for asylum. Being British sucks anyway.
If immigrants didn't come to this country a lot of u, including both sides of my family, would not exist so can we drop the whole 'xenophobia' which we know is just nationalism, white supremacy and fucking racist ass views.
Theresa May can round up British black people and deport them and MSM tell us Corbyn and Labour are a threat to British Jews 
@coping_maga There is absolutely still racism in the UK, but I will still say we have it better, police are a lot less of a threat to the Black population and racists are a lot less upfront, it mainly comes quietly in things like xenophobia, which I would say is better, though still not good.
@kitmalthouse Is that why your party voted to let children in the UK go hungry, and to leave children of asylum seekers open to hideous exploitation?You're the party of *hurting* children.
@PatriotActive66 @DavieFae If you cant deport them , take them out National security and the safety of out nation is the number 1 priority
@Nigel_Farage looks like young men of military age. deport them now
@GeoffBarton9 @JakeWri38029870 @Nigel_Farage Surely you can’t be in support of illegal migrants being housed in hotels across the UK courtesy of the UK taxpayer. You can claim asylum with paying a human trafficker. The whole point is they want to be undetected.

@Roccodumpster The identities of these illegals would obviously have to be known in order to pay them money. If their identities are known, they should be sent back to their own countries instead of being allowed to burden the rest of us

@ScotTories Why did you cheer when NI got to stay in single mkt and keep EU citizenship but laugh when  these rights were removed from Scottish people although they voted to remain in the EU by a much larger margin than NI did. Are Scottish people 2nd class citizens in their own country.
Ho lee shit. British trans people have been granted asylum in other countries because Britain is so anti-trans https://t.co/e9lwCwS20B
This was brilliant, &amp; an area I'm passionately interested in. The systemic way of dismissing asylum seekers on the basis that they don't have enough faith, or that their faith isn't getting them suitably persecuted, is awfully paralleled in their treatment of LGBT+ applicants too https://t.co/PxIIjW0bfP

@PianoGiuoco @SeaTomdee @NSWHealth @GladysB @NSWCHO Please explain how eliminating the virus for months and all opening to one another incompetent, stupid or pathetic? As far as I was aware they would have achieved open border policy within the same time frame as fed government wanted only ones holding Aus back had been NSW/Vic.
@AsylumMatters No no no. Most ‘asylum seekers’ don’t qualify for asylum. Imagine how much more difficult it would be to deport them if they’d got jobs. No to #lifttheban
Stop treating asylum seekers like second class citizens, denying people the right to work and forcing them into poverty. Policy making should be based on human need &amp; informed insights not driven by dog whistling to bigoted idiots..     #LiftTheBan
@JamesMa03661497 @WilliamThorpeW1 @gesufaleg @SasminLeBon @JewishLabour Really? Or did he suggest many were not asylum seekers but economic migrants trying to cheat the system?And yes your belief is racist that non white people who have met Farage and shared a podium with him wouldn’t click he is a massive racist, but somehow you can spot this.
@MariajStephens Something tells me it will all change on December 31st, when we run out of people to man the border controls and employ asylum-seekers to do long hours processing the entry-paperwork for all those lorries.

@_DjTC_ @ChalybeateSpa @CrimeLdn @LFC_blano ‘Asylum shopping’ is when refugees choose a country other than that prescribed by the regs to apply for political asylum, to choose the one which will offer the best reception/welfare conditions, or to lodge an application in another country after being dismissed.

@graham669 @danwilson124 @tricky_bloke @BorisJohnson Re-read what Wilson said.  "Illegal EU Immagrants"  My exacerbation was aimed at that comment. How can an EU citizen be illegal? It's just ignorant, xenophobic nonsense, and completely misses the point about how productive migrants have been in this country.

@PatriotActive66 and yet they cant deport them and let more in.

Two very different ways of treating these illegal/economic migrants/asylum seekers.France aggressively dismantling the illegal camps in fields &amp; the Uk provides hotels or Army camps, food &amp; money.Entirely a problem of our own making by a government lacking in political will. https://t.co/mGV6ZuDW99

@Telegraph As a condition of new immigration rules, why aren't housing purchases limited for people from overseas like New Zealand? If housing was not available via Visa purchase, (i.e. a 1-2 million pound property purchase), would we have "Generation Rent"?

@anderthal_neal @piersmorgan You can choose to go to those countries. These passports will end up as proof needed to access 99% of places in the UK and if you do not have one you will be a virtual outcast, a 2nd class citizen.

@Iromg Yeah. Strip citizenship from anyone you don't like. Moron.
@changed_gear I would have said yes. Everyone regardless of crime or character deserves to keep their citizenship but I guess Patel doesn't agree with that so perhaps not.
@Chotapegs @MickGreenhough That’s overall migration and not illegals.It’s not good either way but they are not being built specifically for illegals 
@changed_gear Should Boris Johnson keep his citizenship?

@Alexandriasdumb @PhilosophyTube @shaun_vids "I would deport thousands of immigrants for trans healthcare" isn't something you have to say you know. Like you could just keep that to yourself.
@Wiijimmy @KatyMontgomerie @Fox_Claire I don't find the concept of trans existing extremely offensive at all and you shouldn't put words into people mouths.As an ex-supporter of Stonewall, Amnesty, Ilga, and many other human rights groups.  I do have a rightful concern where the trans lobby is going, as do the many.

@MarinaHyde Gild The Wall should indeed be the new Tory party three word slogan. Very apt.
@dpjbtg @jdportes @JGForsyth You’re still coming here under false pretences if you get a tourist visa then apply for asylum!  It’s not difficult to grasp. That makes it unofficial. No wonder so much of the country is so easy to fool with these critical thinking skills.
@Mr_Chas @JGForsyth ??? Your claim is that arriving at a UK airport on  (say) a study visa and claiming asylum is an "official route."? Wrong. Try thinking before tweeting.
@RonJere24404501 @theSNP Snp has opened up recruiting offices in Syria, Yemen, Iraq with the sloganYou hate ? Become a SNP member today and we'll offer you asylum and the company of like minded people.

@Lottesometimes @Lauren9Dudley Yeah, I later spoke to a police officer/mate about it, both the husband and wife were asylum seakers from Iran, and he said that maybe the police didn't want to start an investigation that could take a long time, knowing they could be deported at any time? But yes, it's shocking.

How is revoking citizenship racist you ask? Because it is against international law to make someone stateless. That is to strip them of citizenship leaving them with nothing. So someone who only had British citizenship cannot be stripped of their citizenship
A more immediate issue, is, as so often happens with refugees, that what a government pledges and what it does tend not to be wholly in sync. Hundreds of refugees have been left in limbo as the State Department continues to cancel flights. https://t.co/RDShri9U5j

@Mal_DuBois We already spend enough on the NHS. We need to trim off wasteful NHS spending &amp; focus on its core aims. We need a senior army medic to look at it from the bottom up @MattHancock. HS2 is unnecessary &amp; a waste of money. All illegal migrant costs to come out of aid budget.

@rcsloggett Labour could and possibly should say: we've had enough of waiting and start its own cross party approach and build a plan for 2023 ready for when/if it takes power. Govt then has to join or start its own process. Would build similar pressure to the Dubs child refugee amendment

@_knucklebone Oh man, I immigrated to the UK from the US 2 years ago and I remember exactly how stressful the entire visa process was. I hope yours is smooth and timely!! (I went the work visa route, but a friend of mine went the marriage route and it was stress city all around).
@sheffielduni @UofGlasgow @EdinburghUni @Cambridge_Uni @UniofOxford All UK universities should hv demanded UK govt to extend visa for their students who graduated in 2019-20.We graduated in #COVID times, spent millions but got nothing. We didnt get any work exposure or internship

@bergerbell Border controls fatally undermine the EU's founding principle of Free Movement of people and the Schengen borderless areas.It also destroys their idea of ever-closer union too.Yet the FBPE types simultaneously support both positions.
They dug up a law which suggests that as a Bengali under the age of 21 she has Bangladeshi citizenship. Therefore she has dual citizenship, and revoking her British citizenship will not leave her stateless. They found a loophole.
@AdamWagner1 Interesting how would this apply to those of us with dual citizenship travelling using the other country document.
What’s with the rather conspiratorial recorded voice message on @ukhomeoffice asylum telephone line that says “It seems to be very busy at the moment”? I laughed 1st heard it as sounded like a spoof. Is it supposed to be putting off people trying to claim asylum?

@DaveO71085379 @liamgallagher You like problems but don’t offer solutions. Here’s an idea. Asylum seekers cost the U.K. £2.5 billion a year. Corporate tax evasion - £90 billion. One is constantly talked about by media, the other is not. Maybe we need to change the conversation?

Talk about broadcasting your ignorance. You can't apply for asylum outside of country you are seeking it in. Resettlement has been paused since March. So no "official routes". It's also illegal to penalise asylum seekers for manner of entry. There is no "distinction" to make. https://t.co/XhiRG78Tx7
@JGForsyth What is the official route to apply for asylum from outside the UK? The only way that you can do it is to enter the country and it is not illegal to do so for the purpose of claiming asylum. I am sure you know this so suggest you correct this misinformation.
@PercyP13 @DaveAtherton20 @Wobler11 @pritipatel The document says “from being persecuted”.  Most of these illegals are not being persecuted.  They are economic migrants and therefore should just be sent back.  Stop the monies we give them and it’ll soon stop
@Clee100_ @sergio75035352 @yoursayontheUK @ajmpolite @sunshineonleith The point is we have an open land border with the EU in Ireland. Freedom of movement offered free travel.

@VanJamsDMV @LosLazyMustache  no part of my visa fee is that I pay into their NHS system, which I think is fair. My visa is for 2.5 years and the fee was £1500 but I never have to pay for anything else. “Pre-existing condition” is not a thing. U.S made that up, you’re just in need of medical care.

One of the darkest tricks to sway public perception the government has pulled is conflating the already costly and draconian immigration system with the completely separate draconian asylum system. Asylum seekers aren't "jumping queues", and they can't get visas before arriving.

Well we're not surprised. The way the Government deals, or rather DOESN'T deal with dangerous foreign criminals able to easily enter the UK under the guise of seeking asylum is beyond shambolic!
Due to Home Office timidity, activist judges and handwringing leftys we now have over 10,000 foreign criminals on our streets. Deport! https://t.co/M6wwpF4XQr

@eliistender10 In 2006 a court case &amp; a visa limbo preventing me from starting a new job left me broke for 2 months. I ran out of food at the same time my landlord threatened to evict me. An old colleague figured out I  hadn’t eaten for three days and brought me food supplies. Still tears me up
@iwasid That Zionism was appropriated by hard right paramilitary/terrorist groups who ended up taking root in the nascent Israeli state, does nothing to dispel the reality that the vast majority of Jews in Palestine were, by any definition, asylum seekers not settlers...
I've been an asylum seeker in the UK for over a year. I emailed UKVI to ask about work dispensation, because I am eligible for one. I was told they don't handle asylum cases. 1/
I quite like that all Tommy Robinson's followers will now start sending him money which his bankruptcy administrator will now be in charge of. The irony of their money being paid to the Syrian refugee who will then donate much of it to refugee charities is wonderful. https://t.co/Kxrd5IjTgK
@iwasid They were victims of persecution seeking asylum in the one place in the world where they (unlike any other population group) had a continuous presence since records began...
@iwasid No - re-read please. There is no evidence to suggest that the vast majority of Jews who migrated to Palestine prior to 1947 did so with 'active' objective of anything other than seeking refuge and asylum from persecution in Europe.

@jtarkington @SenTedCruz Ask yourself how this would even work if they’re undocumented. No, seriously. How would it even work?Because then you realise it’s a Republican scare tactic.

The only reason they are stripping Shamima Begum of her citizenship is because she is brown and Muslim. Why do white serial rapists/mass murderers with foreign ancestry remain in England? This is setting such a dangerous precedent and I fear for any POC in the UK! #bbctbq

@johnmcternan @glasgowswestend John, as a Labour member I think you are wrong to pose the Brexit question as young against old. Surely the lesson was that we ignored the resentment felt by the poorest and insisted on free movement ar all costs. And what do you say about Maastricht and its neo liberal economics
@LittleBoats2020 If it wasn't for migrant our population would actually decrease, jobs would be plentiful, wages would go up, less polution, less congestion and less demand on services. We could be self sufficient in food production and not need to build on green land as homes would be plentiful.
@GrumpyBangali No new developments. They have refused to even take an application. Ye the British public via the media on repeat keep playing this she could get citizenship elsewhere
It's not just Covid. Illegals could apply for asylum in France. That they don't shows they're not genuine refugees. And should be promptly deported. Instead they're "lawyered up" with public money &amp; if/when they run out of appeals they just stay here. https://t.co/G5WpL8p8Hd

@alonso_hoyt @bbcbigquestions Also race is one of the issues that is at the heart of how her banishment came about. Letts had his citizenship stripped six months after Begum, not to mention the press coverage was markedly different.

@LizzyRhodes5 @bbcbigquestions @Emma_A_Webb I know, in the debate they were actually saying she lost her citizenship because of racism, which is absolute nonsense, Jack Letts, a white guy with British and Canadian citizenship had his British citizenship removed, so that argument goes out of the window about racism.
@Bickerrecord @donpaskini @Neal_Compass @Dannythefink On balance, it seems to me societies with some focus on citizenship (eg Canada, US, Britain, Australia) have an opportunity to use it to de-other. It becomes reciprocally understood that the children of migrants are understood to be equally British, Canadian etc.

@goa_kev @JolyonMaugham I am ashamed of this country. The present government fuels racism and the flag waving Little Englanders lap it up. I used to believe things would improve, but Brexit has allowed the bigots to voice their abhorrent xenophobia. #removethetorygovernment #racism

@OKeefeDarren @anandMenon1 Yes, but the more important mechanism, they claim, is a *reaction* against the perceived xenophobia underlying Brexit!  [As I said, I don't necessarily find this convincing. But that's their argument!]
@CR_OBrien @StevePeers @Schroedinger99 @michaelgove @BorisJohnson @pritipatel @GiselaStuart I think this is the trick, the Withdrawal Agreement only provides for one status and once a citizen brings themselves within the WA they receive the protections, benefits of it. They can’t really fall out of it just because they have PSS which is a creature of the UK not the WA.
Turing scheme details out. Clearly isn't replicating Erasmus. No incoming component and default financial contribution to students not impressive. E.g. £136pw towards maintenance in high cost countries like Australia, which would expect around £150pw for its own student visa.

@vern1066999 @ukhomeoffice It's not illegal to enter the UK via irregular means in order to seek asylum, as there is no other way.

@MajorityRules2 Deport all the illegals. Cancel the woke culture. Weed out those on generous benefits that don’t need to be on them. Match up the unemployed with appropriate jobs. Have a massive buy British campaign. Increase stop and search.
@obtownsend It's far fetched to me because we do have these camps now-we've found out exactly what we will tolerate when housing asylum seekers. Treating people who have fled persecution as 2nd class citizens is not going to cause revolution in the UK. We're all complicit, as Muriel said.
@MajorityRules2 Deport illegals , all of them

The only mention of immigration by Priti Patel is the points system. This is a smokescreen. Boris Johnson said on TV soon after winning the 2019 election he won't change Britain's (chaotic/unjust) asylum system. He didn't say why. And he didn't say he can't. https://t.co/0ZWAcN1FGl

@DavidMWilley1 Not true. There are mandatory questions on citizenship and country of birth.

@Iromg What a moronic question! what exactly have they done to warrant such an extreme measure of having their citizenship removed? Not that it could happen. All they've done is decide not to take on a public role due to toxic press coverage &amp; oh look! you're part of that coverage!

@davidschneider @CShank59 Hmm. I think you mean that the headlines aren’t “right on”. It’s not racist to deport criminals to their country of domicile. Pretty normal/desirable, and in most cases I’d expect them to be white Europeans. An odd choice to add in there.

@BorisJohnson A sickening and horrifying crime. Like so many But you DO have the power to stop some of them.... stop the invasion and deport all foreign criminals.
This misconceptions are harmfulWe face a lot of abuse and xenophobia We deal with assholes because they treat us badly based on our nationality We loose incomeWe have to lie about where we are fromFuck racists
@Jamesmack007 @ANTIWHITEBRITA6 @LBC Religion is indeed curse, and Eastern European human trafficking dominates Europe, it's just the far-right doesn't care because the criminals are white and the victims are foreigners.
@belivethisshit @JuliaHB1 @jessphillips Call it what you want, but an illegal gathering is still a gathering.
@SkyNews Presumably she will be stripped of her British citizenship like others in similar situations. Ah she’s married to a billionaire.....Idea that she could be extradited is farcical.
@pritipatel You need to stop 2 tier policing. BLM/Antifa marches, Muslim marches in Regent St &amp; other protests all get ignored by police middle of a pandemic. But as soon as indeginous mainly 'white' people are involved, police take a stand. Ignored safety issues with illegals on dinghys
Theresa May sacked Priti Patel for her attempts to divert UK taxpayer funds to Israel after her undocumented "off-book" meetings in Israel.How the hell is she not in prison for treason but is instead Home Secretary sending her boot boys in to assault peaceful mourning women?
Thousands of people turned up to an illegal vigil and are shocked they are met with police?? Fuck right off #SheWasJustWalkingHome #ReclaimTheNight #CurfewForMen #metpolice #SarahEverard
Whether it's grooming gangs or hotels for illegals immigrants, the incompetence of @pritipatel endangers us all. https://t.co/B44wprRc2t
@VinnyMcAv Everyone saying that this was an illegal gathering are so fucking pathetic. Get a grip.
Putting more funding into the police??The same police who themselves actively discriminate, perpetuate and incite violence against women, especially those who are Black, queer, trans, Muslim, immigrants and women seeking asylum? The police do nothing
@pritipatel Making it illegal will only make us more determined to stand up for our rights. Your a total waste of space, no candles for the girls groomed by illegals, you couldn't even stop the illegals. I feel a peoples army is in the making, your pure evil 
Getting married has never been on my radar but I think I’m now ready to marry a foreigner just to get out of this fucking fucked up country!!!! Quite partial to a Canadian or maybe a Dutchman? Must have a beard and own teeth, Apply within.#TheHumorKeepsMeSane
Don't be under any illusions, if there is an amnesty for illegal immigrants the Tories will suffer from a significant loss of votes. These mainly male migrants are here to take, not to give and we are the ones they are taking from. https://t.co/Q80w97c3Lq
scrim dont be a foreigner or ur getting abuse
@IanDunt @afneil I couldn’t either. Amazing how many times she defied the repeated and reasonable request to disperse from an illegal mass gathering
@rafayagha @IainBaileIain @AyoCaesar @metpoliceuk Three so called refugees got sentenced to 48 year's in prison by Teesside crown court for kidnapping and raping a woman in Redcar so let's blame all refugees and deport the lot
We need stronger laws to help protect women and make them feel safe Anyone attacking women should be charged with premium sentance longer and more resolute Any non national should be deported and visa stripped straight away after serving sentences lets protect women #DickOut
"Hate crime law is a way for the police to appear that it is on our communities’ side in an attempt to gain legitimacy, whilst justifying the expansion of policing &amp; surveillance which primarily target poor, Black, Muslim &amp; undocumented communities."https://t.co/U6Luz7iHhY
@ooohdannyboy @Tommy_Lewis0 @YvetteHenson @Phil_Osophi They covered it up because she'd been an illegal immigrant and the media speculated she was Somalian. She's in Rampant doing 10 years. So no fear of arresting anyone else for this horrific murder of an innocent child. Who gives a flying fk what nationality they're caught, end of
Brexit is a mess.We have people queuing for foodbanks.We have healthcare workers quitting and not training due to low pay and working conditions.We’ve got rampant Xenophobia and racism. Women don’t feel safe anymoreCorrupt police and politician’sPoverty is up.I’m exhausted
@IainDale @metpoliceuk At an illegal demonstration with ACAB signs, spray paint and shouting" All cops are bastards"? Not all were there for the same purpose.
@Care4Calais I agree! Such a demand for bikes! Would be great to set up a charity specifically for provision of bikes for refugees and asylum seekers and other vulnerable people. X
If true meghan wouldnt give up american citizenship because she planned to go into politics, would that not suggest she planned not to stay for long? It just gets more and more crazy doesnt it?
@unlabour @BeckettUnite @Keir_Starmer They came for the migrant I wasn’t a migrant they came for the Gypsies I wasn’t a Gypsie they attacked the sick the disabled our women our trade unions and then there was no one left to speak out for me for fear of being beaten or arrested in England in the 21st century
#Jess Phillips MP jumping on the latest bandwagon. Going on about the Sarah Everard murder &amp; vigil. She is all over the media about crimes against women. Grooming gangs not mentioned. She wasn’t all over the media when young Sarah Jones was murdered by an illegal immigrant !
@davidrobbo66 You  twat .......imagine  that many football fans turning  up at an illegal  event ...question  would that be the home secretary  fault...grow a pair and dont be a twat
@Bildge3 @MattsBigMouth @RachelKiki_ @SadiqKhan Besides, two illegals don't make a legal so your point is a shit one Matt.
@BrendanChilton @saskquo Protesters know that if their “cause” is racist, genderthingamebob, islamisst, greeny the police service will dance, kneel, escort and protect them.If you should be a citizen concerned about your Country. Immigration or lawlessness, then you will get your head cracked.
@WelshCelt @pritipatel And do gooders really think that these illegals that are coming in from France really want to live like us. They need to be sent straight back to where they came from why should we look after them?
Police chief should resign for authorising the police to disperse an illegal crowd gathering during a global pandemic. GIVE IT A FUCKING REST WILL YOU  https://t.co/V6Q3O5pQKg
@JasonMc08352085 @LordIanAustin @JewishChron It's not the wall that sophisticated apartheid accusers object to but the supposed lower status of arab Israelis. (Either that or the political condition of arabs in area c) There are many arguments against this accusation though.
@LanceForman @LRevoker @LoveEU67 @Iloveautumn2 Nobody in their right mind willfully increases the obstacles for their existing customers. Only a madman would do that for their suppliers too. You and your asylum did that and told people there would be no downsides and, anyway, that was necessary to keep out foreigners.
@Andrew_Adonis @NottmResistance Same when a government lies to dupe people into supporting an illegal war, I heard.
@Iank11b @DOSSharpShooter @mileslunn @EMRAdam @Polysesouvient @CPC_HQ I wish that was the case when we followed you into an illegal war in Iras
The exception being, apparently, white men protesting against The Other. Anti-immigration protests? Fine. Because immigrants, especially undocumented, are deemed a threat to the state and its authority. Somehow. Half starved kids in boats are scary, yo.
@GrumpyOldLab @tinkernurse We need stronger laws to help protect women and make them feel safe Anyone attacking women should be charged with premium sentance longer and more resolute Any non national should be deported and visa stripped straight away after serving sentences lets protect women
A racist right wing government, hell bent on making life hostile for refugees &amp; asylum seekers, championing for protests to be deemed an offence, giving police more powers, &amp; demonising the working class.Also making themselves &amp; their friends richer.This is a fascist government
You are a good HS, please up the immigration and deportation of illegals It will mean so much, nothing to do racism but Sovereignty  and Law.I hate racism in all it's forms and disguises but this Great Nation can no longer accept that EU allow the departures from their COUNTRIES https://t.co/MAUNE3kHM5

@Bee65Cee @AndrewT33449512 @JolyonMaugham You mean the Scottish government that got caught out covering up for a imported grooming gang made up of asylum seekers and so called refugees idiot
Remember the 60s-70s racism was rife in fact it was the worse years. We have learned to live together might even give the odd good morning a smile. What worries me now are the new breed of illegals that hate us so much they want to rob rape kill 4 Allah still they come WTF4.?
@SteveDB @YvetteHenson @jaycee1001 Got the nationality wrong but she had been an illegal immigrant. And known to be a danger to children.
@pritipatel There was an illegal gathering,it turned ugly,you should be supporting the police,we are in lockdown after all.
@YvetteHenson Disgusting, but get ready for more of this as illegals flood in daily helped by the government and not reported my MSM.  I despair of what this country and Europe will look like in another 20 years.  It will be an absolute sh*t hole, it could be stopped now, but won’t be.

@LBC @AndrewCastle63 It was an illegal gathering! What don’t you guys understand?? If it had been BLM, Gay Pride, antiBrexit, Etc they would have to all have been treated the same. No matter what. Can you imagine what would happen if the police started to pick and choose who to apply the law too??

This is 2nd Steal fr decent tax payers within 3M by corrupt Treacherous DNC.
@VinnyMcAv It was an illegal gathering. What’s shocking is that the police tried to break it up? If only they would have shown the same vigour during the grooming gang trials when there was no lockdown? But we all know why they didn’t eh! Hypocrites the lot of them!!
@SloughForEU misogyny is such a perfect companion to racism, chauvinism &amp; xenophobia...
@britishbullybee It’s a bit more baiting by the french, rising to it is exactly what they want, in the same way macron is attempting to flood us with illegals. Our government is far too passive with this shit.
@pritipatel I don’t think you care remotely about Sarah Everand. You also don’t care about the lives of asylum seekers letting them rot in unfit CovID unsafe barracks. There’s nothing but inhumanity at the top of Government and it’s truly disturbing to see.

@liam_brown_03 @forwardnotback I agree they attended an illegal gathering - However the reaction was disproportionate to the crime - and when considering the context of reason for the gathering - it would be funny if it were no so ridiculous and disgusting
@FoxxysTweets No such outrage when EU migrant and already convicted serial sex offender was found guilty of killing Libby Squires few months ago.

I don't really get the "we can't sack Cressida Dick because she's a woman and it would set back female empowerment". Otherwise it would be true that sacking Priti Patel would set back the fight against xenophobia, and that's clearly not the case. https://t.co/GfvuZvuSsv
@prenticejones5 Charles is equally a racist. If he was part of the discussions on changing the letters patent to deprive the first biracial child in the royal family his title birthright, then he is a full on raging racist. This is not about slimmed down monarchy because they are skint already
@PippaCrerar Brought up better than to attend an illegal gathering and get so whipped up as to be arrested. The doorstep light on would have been powerful. Evil needs to stay off the streets, however the same people protesting are those stopping extradition flight for murders,  rapist and DV.
@MickeyD44314901 @MailOnline I think it would be better to deport foreign rapists rather than impose a curfew on ALL men. @BaronessJennyJones what do you say? #CurfewForMen

I’m sorry but the met being hounded over policing an illegal vigil held during lockdown when families couldn’t attend funnels sounds ridiculous to me! Another case of people wanting to pick and choose when rules apply!
I wish #bennylynburke was getting more media attention too. She was only 25 and a mother to two children, one of which was murdered with her in Dundee when she is from Bristol. Just a few days before this all blew up. Hope it’s not because she is a filipina migrant. https://t.co/FhHyRUU7bX

@DaddyoverPounds @BBCNews @AndrewMarr9 @SkyNews I know. I wonder what new laws targetting men only they will pressure our spineless politicians in to passing over this.

We have a Home Secretary who is a bully and would not have allowed her parents to live in the UK..Where is the call for this dangerous maverick to do the right thing. Resign - or deport her parents.
@MayaOppenheim @Independent It was horrific what happened to Sarah. I would ask though where was the uproar and protests from feminists over the rotherham and rochdale grooming gangs?

@HTOranje @charmagh5 @CraigMurrayOrg The police didn’t know that the man they killed was Brazilian, or that he was an illegal immigrant (I say this for context because the implication is that the press conspired with the police because he was illegal).

@MichaelOmagh @g_gosden Immigrant is something we associate with Johny Foreigner but when we are in someone else’s country, we invented expats.  Expats beats foreigners any day.
@Nigel_Farage If the killer was a migrant, a refugee or a muslim then you would have shaped the story about 'foreign men and their obsession with white British women' because that isn't the story you're deflecting the reality of misogyny and male privilage in the UK.
@orr_robinson @shane_r It means hushing up grooming gangs because it’s “racist” to prosecute them. It means the slow erasure of women’s sport. It means the murders of people like Lorraine Cox and Emily Jones barely making headlines. It means pretending that economic migrants are asylum seekers.

xenophobia and racism towards asians needs to stop
@JustineClaire65 The government tried to deport convicted rapists and murderers. The left opposed their deportation. Now they are demanding they be kept safe. There are numerous convicted rapists and murders walking the streets who should have been deported after serving their sentences.
People are not that stupid. If you open the border (Biden), people will cross it. They know that. https://t.co/Dmq11uE2Dh
@YvetteHenson If you give a shit about this little girl or her family you'll delete this. The person who killed her was not a somalian migrant at all. This is dog whistling racism and shame on you for sharing it.
@pmc871 UK is fucked right now, I'm a UK citizen born and bred and would gladly take another passport without hesitation... Non-EuroZone European countries absolutely
@Stone_SkyNews One of them is an illegal immigrant - still not used to the time zone
30 infants remain in orphanages in NE Syria, while many will undoubtedly be unidentified or undocumented. Some of my interviewees rejected their IS-born babies, viewed as a reminder of rape and trauma. Others saw their children taken by IS militants as they vanished in hiding
@PoliticsForAlI @LBC Deport them all, wherever they come from.This needs to stop!
Those Fellows were killed by a  foreigner, a migrant, a person of colour.  Mustn't say or do anything negative regarding them https://t.co/u1wdfrmBcU
@BoozeAndFagz Also the Labour Party: don’t deport rapists! (But only if they are from Jamaica)
@Steve13p @earthdog_58 @Flakmagnet1 @metpoliceuk This 'event' as you call it which was in fact an Illegal gathering was also a public health risk, wonder how many of these woke idiots were whining last week about nurses pay and them putting their lives on the line whilst a week later adding to the problem.Again police did job
Where's the vigil for Lorraine Cox? Murdered and dismembered by an Iraqi asylum seeker. Trial ongoing #SarahEverard https://t.co/CWzjq0UPjb
@davemacladd It's a shame those women hadn't been asylum seekers the Ugandan would have praised our brave police officers in the face of the ungrateful
Shamima Begum: Britain's treatment of IS bride criticised - as new photos of her in Syrian refugee camp emergehttps://t.co/BSSS4Cel75I’ve had enough beheading and killing. Pay for me to come back. Ffs. https://t.co/1mF4vRhzMk
@m19_joanna That’s sad. Our biggest problem in the UK is the male illegals who behave like ferals and do not have our values .... it’s in their DNA.
@Bigdogdigs Get rid of illegals ......
@Oliverolisah @AfricaFactsZone You are the cause of xenophobia here stay in your country
@TheCaveMugsboro You were refusing to disperse from an illegal gathering due tomcovid restrictions. Thats why you were removed.You then resisted so you were arrested.The police fucked up and were too heavy handed but it doesnt change the facts of the situation.
@iminhopeworld I don't want them to even submit to scammys next year....can't take their continued humiliation. They dont need to work any harder.  Everyone else does in checking their xenophobia.
@PaulBrandITV @amnesty The bill doesn’t stop peaceful protests, only affects disruptive ones. If they don’t even know that, then they should probably shut up.
Who the hell is giving out $2000 monthly and can I have citizenship https://t.co/QaJ9Diaajk
@laurenboebert You as a non indigenous American are an illegal alien and your ancestors committed ethnic cleansing and genocide!
If you want your 4th wedding to be easy and stress-free. Don't try and marry a foreigner that's half your age. Especially when you haven't even got your shit together. #90DayFiance
@Lucas_Mooree @yuilly12 @BritishAlba @Telegraph We recruited most of those “terrorists”  however, taking someones citizenship away without evidence of crimes is rather hypocritical when trying to educate other countries with democracy, don’t you think?
@vickyford @andrealeadsom I am shocked by the protesters breaking the law to attend an illegal gathering and putting the police in a very awkward position. They whole country hates to see what has happened to Sarah and other women. Even us white older men.
Sweden: Muslim migrant participates in brutal gang rape, won’t be deported, avoids prison, gets community service. https://t.co/ohMpCL41Tq
@yeahshewrites It certainly is. Get that US coin  but also maybe get some kind of European citizenship at some point in case the US also goes to shit (more than it has in the past ).
I am fed up. Will the people who follow me, my family, my friends who are seemingly supporting those who attended what is currently in legislation an illegal gathering, look me in the eyes and say they believe I am a murderer, bastard and violent?
It’s sick political play that makes 0 sense, causing thousands of families &amp; binational partners to suffer both mentally &amp; financially. Also putting us at more risk. When will the xenophobia stop @POTUS @jrpsaki @SecPompeo @SecBlinken @VP  #loveisnottourism #mentalhealthmatters https://t.co/BWwHv3a4DJ
I believe all children, from all backgrounds have incredible potential.  Prostitution stops kids reaching their potential. English Collective of Prostitutes ambition to decriminalise prostitution, reintroduces slavery, child sexual exploitation, rape, human trafficking. https://t.co/a98kJaoMzF
- My cousin Rianna working as a paramedic through the COVID pandemic in London- And finally to the people I don't know but are making the world better - the organisers of the Clapham Common vigil, blak community organisers in Oz &amp; UK, refugee women holding their communities up
Yet they focus on asylum seekers and benefits cheats these are the real crooks https://t.co/rBiqsDOKQ2
@Breaking911 SOURCES: @peirsmorgan applying for US citizenship to run for US President.****Get outraged!! Can you believe this?? What qualifications does he have??
@PoliticsForAlI @LBC The left opposed deportation of convicted rapists and murderers. Can you get your demands straight. Do you want rapists and murderers off the street? If you do then support Priti trying to deport them.
A lunatic has taken over the asylum.  https://t.co/Qeb5RZol0t#climate #OECD
Boycott your stupid show and your obvious xenophobia . Goodluck b*tch. @RecordingAcad
Steve,  try .... they were illegals. Shocking!!!! https://t.co/a81UlvYvf6
@pritipatel @pritipatal stop the flow of illegals in to the country. Soon you won't be able to cope with what's coming. Sweden ! Unsafe for girls/women to go out after dusk due to attacks on women because of mass immigration. We will be next 
@_NatashaDevon How she can sit there with a straight face talking about protecting women when she's happy to deport people with absolutely no regards to their safety. And being part of govt that purposefully puts its citizens at risk daily... SHE HAS THE AUDACITY... https://t.co/8GEkdNkB0i
@stevelawsreport @WelshCelt With women feeling threatened when walking the streets the way its going with this intake of illegals we all will feel unsafe walking the streets.
@Rob01233212John @pritipatel I agree, with less asylum seekers there would be less hate crime carried out against them by white racists.Oh, is that not what you meant?Too late now!

@brooklynmarie @BGHeaven I thought the wall the Mexicans paid for was gonna solve all these problems?
@NadiaWhittomeMP @SistersUncut Typical labour, an illegal march and moaning about the police again nothing to do with the death of her. The left have their own agenda. Why shout fuck the police. Shame you didn't have the motivation to speak up again the Muslim grooming gangs, what about them girls?
@pritipatel Blimey, you do get an awful lot of racists commenting on your posts don’t you? I look forward to the day when red faced old working class men wake up and realise migrants and asylum seekers aren’t our enemy, the Tories are
Is it me or are the lunatics running the asylum
I have every sympathy for Syrian refugees having worked in the Middle East and European refugee camps, where thousands of rape and torture victims sought medical help in our clinics. Sadly the Syrian opposition was dysfunctional and power hungry with no sense of unity.
@dentist_908 @maxgordon19 Scary .. as I said, at that rate in only a mere 10,000 years you will have taken over the country !Though if course, Islam will be long dead within 200 years - so we shall simply have to keep most Muslim refugees and illegals out while we wait for that 
Jihadi Jack Letts was stripped of his UK citizenship .. and he's white. ISIS members come in all shapes, colours and sexes, but all share the same murderous ideology.   https://t.co/wzIScPDPs4 https://t.co/CekUQy3BB2
@clong88 @ScottMurphy13 @barfootio1 @LisaGeddes49 @SkyNews Again little boy, it's not one thing it's EVERYTHING!!! human trafficking are the words. Now sssh, not about you. Not about me. LISTEN!!!!
@toryboypierce The other great mistake was allowing a huge immigration population into Europe.  And if course the EU offered free movement to all other European countries. What a mess!!!
80 seat majority ,stop the  invasion, deport all illegals,deport foreign criminals,go WTO ,no more devolved government,no mayor's, simple solution
@megcaddickxx But I wouldn’t go to an illegal mass gathering . Yes people struggle to socially distance in places that are open and we can go. Tesco’s a nightmare but that gathering never should’ve happened and police were just doing their job
US visa processing delays hit Chinese students https://t.co/8fINR0woGt
@NicolaSturgeon @scotgov You are digging up the greenbelt around Edinburgh to achieve this you uber witch! Use brown field sites! Better still, get rid of all the illegals!
Btw at today's #SarahEverardVigil somebody said that we wouldn't be up in arms if she hadn't been a middle-class cis white British woman. And we KNOW that's true bc migrant women in detention centres have been talking for years about the sexual and physical violence they face.
@TheLastmanship @African41153444 @ShAbdiHersy Calling a Somali baby boomer born in London a refugee, only a Kenyan would say something so retarded. https://t.co/BfIpX3I9F6
@RoySayWhatNow @Soulrnr @nuttydave2010 @StrideSebastian @Telegraph @JohnRentoul We can’t deport foreign criminals or terrorists if they commit their acts of terror on British soil they are tried and put in prison here, like those twoLibyans, the one that planned the Manchester terror attack, and the one that killed three gay men, they have not been sent back
@MeghUpdates Send them to US or ask unhrc to take care them or else help india to deport them back. We are not idiots to spend our hard earned money on these people who came to our country illegally, obtained govt facilities for free &amp; enjoy our resources without any cost.
Should we deport all male migrants in the name of women's right to safety given the number of migrant rape cases?
Mumbai Multi-Millionaire plays the race card."What if she was white?"Let's ask Jack Letts; a White British boy who joined ISIS &amp; was stripped of his Citizenship &amp; is still in detention.Or maybe we should ask Sally-Anne Jones? Nope she was killed!https://t.co/3UK2fgQlI4
@POTUS And you screwed every nurse doctor and first responder who were forced to work overtime and are outside the income limits. Nice job giving free money to illegals and people in prisons though
