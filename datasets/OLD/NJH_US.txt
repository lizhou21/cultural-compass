@jzycaramel @AITA_reddit being an immigrant family isn't a good excuse for being an asshole of a parent. this dude is classist as shit, sprung this decision on his kid last minute, and literally only cares about money and appearances. that isn't magically absolved by immigrant status.
Ok, I have to say it is frustrating when you think your having a dialogue with an individual then they block you. They call you a liar, disrespect you, go off on a rant then block you. @TravestyinUS . I admit we had deferring view points on immigration. I did not attack her view.

@theunion4ev3r @jt_taku @pantomath__ @realDonaldTrump I’m pretty sure illegals still have have rights in usa
@cov19chaos @Tom_Fowdy I thought trumpy banned all Chinese nationals from entering on Jan 31st?Oh and he left the door opened for Americans or people with American visa to come backAnd we should just hold foreign at gun point to keep them from leaving?Such hypocrisy lmao
@lisaforman67 @JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump It was more polite than Trump deserves. He is pure evil in human form. He has systematically abused the children of asylum seeking families and killed thousands of Americans. He is the most vile creature ever to disgrace the White House, and we’ve had a few very vile creatures.
@ScottPresler @realDonaldTrump An open border will put Mexicans in danger…you dumb!
@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump Keeping illegals out of the country isn’t racist idiot.
Let’s get a caravan of a few thousand people and head for Mexico https://t.co/vmjAgogEcq
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Tf you want him to do. Let illegals with the disease come back into the country that is fighting it off.  No thanks
here an idiot brags how his inaction caused an outbreak in the US, which has now spread into Mexico as a result. https://t.co/2N2cWykoQy
Oh, there’s so much more of his “presidency” that will be remembered along side this virus.  Immigrant children and parents separated in cages, political assassination, impeachment, The Wall, and on and on! https://t.co/75SfQ07I10
@MrFounder007 @charliekirk11 you gave no truth crap for brains, also news flash family guy is a left wing bias. I am shocked you even watch something like that. this "Mail-In Ballot was initially promoted by Democrats to allow illegals to vote without any real ID validation" no this is you being an idiot
No freakin way do they get let off the hook!!! Packing plants and factories are death camps right now!!!!!!! https://t.co/69O78A2rpT
Actually, our death toll is a lot higher than Mexico's so they are not trying to migrate over here as much as they were... Your lies are and always have been ridiculously racist and an embarrassment to this country #TrumpIsANationalEmbarrassment #TrumpIsTheWORSTPresidentEVER https://t.co/4xRy0GyB2q
Both Mexico and Canada do NOT want Americans crossing into their countries. But hey you keep spewing lies because sadly YOU are the only one left believing your own crap being peddled!

@HEl_I_Oados_usa She's an immigrant grifter who gets paid mocking #ADOS culture.  Do not buy these stupid shirts.
@HillaryClinton @latinovictoryus Well Trump locks Latinos in cages, calls them criminals, drug dealers and rapists...while he employs undocumented immigrants at his properties.
@EdwardTHardy @realDonaldTrump Either way, with a wide open border, shelter-in-place is meaningless and hypocritical.
@realDonaldTrump Preident has failed to deport the illegal immigrants. This will haunt him in November Elections. @realDonaldTrump @RepSwalwell @SpeakerPelosi
@realDonaldTrump Containing a pandemic versus stopping people from seeking asylum. Too different things, champ. #racist #hoggobblin
@realDonaldTrump I say, make a public announcement that you are willing to heed their previous cries for an open border, and offer escorts of the masses of Mexicans who wish to enter California to any city they choose! Their response, should be priceless doublespeak and hypocrisy.
@cswany2 How are the criminals doing on the streets of California, also the illegals, are all Sanctuary cities shut down?!
@FrickerSr @battle_Esq @I_wish_but @morningmika @gtconway3d 1/ Soros is a Hungarian immigrant who LOVES this country, unlike you who spew hatred toward any immigrant.

@Duncan18200619 @sharisview @SexCounseling @realDonaldTrump Including children and asylum seekers?Because it is not illegal to seek asylum.
@HillaryClinton @latinovictoryus Stop  leave the Hispanic community alone! We don’t need your lies.@BarackObama @POTUS44 lied to the Hispanic people with #DACA and took it from them.... then said @realDonaldTrump did it! We are not putting any votes towards you pedophiles
@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump That’s BS like everything he says, the borders still open. My family lives across the border and they cross everyday. No one working on the wall!! Clown Trump!! 
@Pitch_Purfect20 @robbystarbuck @CNN @POTUS I'm looking at the damage that your Potus is doing right now. Man said he will make Mexico pay for the wall.

@FrickerSr @battle_Esq @I_wish_but @morningmika @gtconway3d 2/ Do you even know what a sanctuary city is?Trump really loves the STUPID ones!

@1970Petersen @TripleD37 @realDonaldTrump The Electoral College was created for a reason. So that the rest of the country would have more of a voice compared to places like NY. As for the Pop Vote, all the nuts and illegals in California were the difference there. And again, I wasn’t voting for Trump to join my family
@IRLILaw @KFOX14 The Mexican government should take responsibility for their citizens entering America we should fine the Mexican government for every illegal alien that shows up on our side of the border!
The Un family deliberately starves their own people and George Bush started an illegal war that cost trillions and claimed millions of lives. shut the fuck up
And like clockwork, out come the Bush apologists.  "We need decency" my ass.  Decency gave us open borders and 3rd world immigration for the last 40 years.  Keep your decency.
The pot is calling the kettle.  Hey, Trump, you know we (USA) have over 55,000 deaths, right? Mexico needs to come out and tell Trump, “WORRY BOUT YO DAMN SELF!” https://t.co/2qizuKlNYd

Absolutely not! If they won't grant access to your child's data for that, they probably know who did it, and they're an illegal immigrant! https://t.co/EVgV45gG3i

Let’s get things straight here. There is no “National Lockdown” Trump refused to make a National Lockdown. He did make a “So of the border Immigrant Lock-Out”.

Sometime you gotta do things you don't want to do or do things don't like to do for others so they can be happy so you can be happy. And visa-versa. Give and take. It's a learning process. Experiment! You can't stay stuck in your own world
@waxmonkey @PacNWResister @politico It’s not an illegals constitutional right either, every state has the right to verify that it is you and not someone else who is casting a vote

Trump has workers going 24/7 to build his #BorderWall and give him a milestone ceremony before the election. Trump has built 341 miles of new fencing. The length of the US-Mexico border is 1,954 miles. https://t.co/hoavpbE3Cn
so trump and his supporters don’t like that illegals don’t pay taxes, but he doesn’t even pay taxes and to them he’s smartalright bro

@thomasparnold Yes the Dems heads were spinning when brought up in Judiciary Committee hearing today. How DARE the Republicans proffer undocumented rumor was their gist, when we've all known this was how the #RussiaHoax was started to begin with.

@PaulHerzog3 @USCIS When they started begging Congress for money some of the representatives with big service centers (think jobs) in their district dug around in USCIS financials, which is what led to the "postponement" then "indefinite postponement" of the furlough they were threatening.
@aflores @USCIS I once got two separate denials stating two entirely different rationales for one application for employment authorization. I think you can find way to cut back.

Here’s the truth. If this country had less black people, less immigrants and poor, we’d be doing what most other countries are doing. Giving every citizen a UBI of 2k per month until this thing is over.

@Yamiche I can’t emphasize enough: Some of those plants had over a dozen infections and instead of closing down they offered low paid workers, many undocumented, 500 dollar bonus to work in unsafe conditions.Big dollar bonuses are COERCIVE to poor workers.If it’s unsafe it’s unsafe.
@AtlanticDevelop @JoeySalads Same as WA and the governors made an illegal pact.
@DavidENorman Making those of us that don't have insurance pay a fee yearly for not having insurance to pay for illegals  health insurance.  Pushing to teach LGBT to children in school. Making California a sanctuary state. Illegals having priority over our homeless population.

@SasuKpop @soompi @Melodia_Muse Of idk 99% of the races other than our own. South Korea is pretty far from an immigrant country so it’s safe to say that they don’t interact with a lot of people of your race, nor aware of the back story of your hairstyles. Until they’re educated properly like I am now
@Karl_Was_Right And immigration, foreign peoples moved there and displaced the native population. Think about that next time you hear someone mention how great immigration is.
I talked with two attorneys who are representing John Doe in the lawsuit, a U.S. citizen who is married to an immigrant who uses an ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number.)
Sanctuary cities?  People being protected that shouldn’t be?  The only people that shouldn’t be protected from prosecution are you and your brood of criminals.  The American people are coming for you and we will have our vengeance.  @realDonaldTrump #ToddlerinChief

@Salandthebadpun Agreed but I’m not sure I love her casting of Sendhil Ramurthy as the immigrant father because it forced the affected accent and crappy Tamil. I’m sure there could have been others cast.

@marklevinshow The Daily Wire report actually shows that Biden was not referring to the travel restriction as being xenophobic. The later tweet referring Trump’s xenophobia is responding to Trump’s reference to COVID as the China virus. Nothing to do with the travel restriction.

DREAMER Alejandro Jimenez was smuggled into America as a boy and, thanks to DACA, is now New Hope, Pennsylvania's first professional boxer.

@mkraju Unfortunately, Trump 'is' correct! Joe Biden has said 'if' he becomes Ptesudtnt he will provide Amnesty _ jobs for immigrants. Where ties that leave the American black man &amp; woman? The Dems have been doing this for 20 plus years now. Isis
@KhiFromNY @1Aplus2A @RockyMountViews @ABC Through Trump, First step act signed, Repealed NAFTA, stopped TTP, Signed peace deals for ISREAL and UAE. Lowered pharm drugs like insulin from 400 to 15. Right to try bill. Attacks human trafficking, first pres. in 40+ to NOT start a war. Don't let them think for you.

@lacylegacy @MikeTalonNYC @realDonaldTrump I agree!  Not to mention that he's putting a stop to human trafficking and drugs coming across our southern border, and providing more jobs.

@CHANLIXBI Where you were born and what citizenship has nothing to do with your race &amp; if you’re a POC or not.Example: A white person can be born to 2 white parents in China but they’re not a POC because they’re not racially or ethnically Chinese.
Weird how @realDonaldTrump never mentioned caravans during the debate. It's not his Freebird, that'd be the wall, but it's at least his Gimme Three Steps.

@cantpickemall @seanhannity They won’t have to the conservative Hollywood celebs are moving to North Korea where Trumps obese buddy will give them asylum?
@realDonaldTrump Yeah, lots of TRump FAILURES. TRUMP UNIVERSITY was a BIG FAIL that made real public at the beginning of his CONJOB OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. Does anyone remember how much DON THE CON had to pay back to the people he CONNED?  It was  MILLIONS. https://t.co/SG0BUVmlDa https://t.co/Hv8QOiS2nu

@jessesingal I just read that he missed the deadline to sign the refugee allotment act for 2021 today. So there will be no refugees in 2021?

I’ve decided I’m gonna do a neversummer in Australia next summer. I can even work for the same company so my odds of getting a job are higher and a working holiday visa is open to US citizens under 30. Hell I may just never come back, you can string them together for 3 years.
@boldjarl @ChesterBreaky @LauraS_442 @TimAlberta So it is racist to state the ugly fact that illegal immigrants adult and child have been raped by other illegals during illegal crossings? It is racist to state the fact that some Muslims marry their cousins, and the Koran has a kill non Muslims in jihad problem?
@chuckwoolery She has Money for illegals. No jail for criminals. No deportations.WhAt does this have to do with stimulus for our citizens and OUR economy and OUR Country?

@MSNBC The American People deserve to know exactly how many illegals are living in our country and especially how many are receiving any type benefits that are funded by US citizen's tax dollars – This is The USA, it's our citizen's country and being a US Citizen is absolutely relevant.
@MayorOfLA @LAPDHQ Can illegals call 311 and request free hot stone massages too ? What other services are being offered at tax payers expense besides legal help ...Of only you cared so much about people here legally and small business... asking too much I guess ...
@MrCrikey @matthewhayesx @SVNewsAlerts Broward county. We don’t count them as us. Hot bed corruption. Human trafficking bad in that area also. Why do think the Mafia in the hay day all had second homes there? Strong hold area.

@GhostStyle84 @Ldev101 @Pink For the black community, he passed the First Step Act (Criminal Justice Reform), lowest unemployment rate EVER for the black community, built the wall (illegal immigrants disproportionately displace African American jobs), PERMANENTLY funded HBCU's

@ShellyMccown @Concealcarrygrl "Authentic" what though?  Did Mexico "authentically" pay for a wall?  Did the deficit "authentically" go down so fast it will "make our heads spin?"   It's not that he's rude and disgusting, it's that he lies constantly and he's a bad leader.
@AnaKasparian Cruz was born in Canada of an American mother; dual citizenship. When Trump made a big deal of it, he signed away his Canadian citizenship. And yet he remains an embarrassment to 2 countries, 2 cultures.

@paulsperry_ Trump is a pathetic, lying loser. Where's the wall? Did Mexico pay? Where's his healthcare plan? You just need to shut up.
@realDonaldTrump Did we get the check from Mexico for the wall yet? Probably not, since it hasn’t been built. The only suckers and losers are your followers.  Start packing.
@realDonaldTrump Mexico didn’t pay for your wall isis still there and what jobs you are delusional 
Go get ‘em, Katie! https://t.co/mAmFfAp9MX
@realDonaldTrump Did he build a wall?Did Mexico pay for it?Did Covid magically disappear?Did we get that health plan he’s promised since his last campaign?Did he release his tax returns like he promised almost 4 years ago?And how can you be pro America when you side with Russia over the US IC?
But the majority of ww voted for him just 4 short years ago... and he was who he is now too. He was a white supremacist, misogynist xenophobe in 2016, so what pray-tell changed? https://t.co/anwTh4mvBw
@realDonaldTrump Caged children, slashed healthcare, revoked LGBTQIA rights, fanned the flames of racism, passed a xenophobic Muslim ban, upheld white supremacy, defunded the VA, downplayed a virus that has so far killed 205,000 Americans.
@paulsperry_ He never got wall built. Mexico did not pay anything. Plus he forgot to promise to kill 200,000 during his campaign. Oh yeah, he did not lock up Hillary.

Then sold back to us for example salt , pineapples,  seafood etc . Our country will never prosper unless we monopolize these resources because these are the jobs for the every day man to get rich . You can't even get a decent contruction job over here without being a foreigner
@lindyli @ReallyAmerican1 @MeidasTouch Three years later, Miller joined Trump’s campaign. Trump’s emotional racism combined with Miller’s sophisticated knowledge of white supremacist propaganda; he introduced gory descriptions of migrant crimes into Trump’s speeches and regurgitated false crime statistics.
Yes, Trump is racist which means his supporters are racist too. https://t.co/sj6RPXwiQo
@CNNPolitics If they have funds available to subsidize these non-citizen uninvited unauthorized foreign intruders and their children, it should instead be going towards softening the hardship of these overbearing college loan repayments for our own income-tax-paying US Citizens instead.
The sticking point for the new stimulus package is that Pelosi wants stimulus checks for illegals and no deportations. JUST SAY NO.
@paulsperry_ Well. Well. This one is very easy to debunk. For now, because it’s late, I’ll only focus on your first statement “Trump delivers his promises.”  Let’s see:- wall on the south border that Mexico will pay for: there’s no wall. The few sections built up weren’t paid by Mexico
@Ilhan Deport Ilhan 'Omar'. Falsified last name to defraud U.S. citizenship.
@PointRanger @paulsperry_ Which ones? The wall that Mexico was paying for? Not golfing? Bringing back manufacturing jobs? Cheaper healthcare? Better trade deals? The only thing he has done is made domestic gas cheaper but that will have a cost down the road.
@JoeBiden Economy - best ever; ty President Trump. Peace in the Middle East. Israel treated like an ally, again. Vets respected &amp; better care at the VA. Illegal Immigration is down &amp; MS 13 being sent home. American businesses coming back &amp; hiring. Merry Christmas is back in the WH.
@realDonaldTrump No wall that you said Mexico would pay for! No replacement of Obamacare like you said! No plan for Covid besides open up! Don the Con!

@CNNPolitics – Every day more and more Americans are waking up – Wanting trade and immigration policies that will put the best interests of our own US CITIZENS first and foremost is not racist or fascist – It's common sense, if you're a US CITIZEN of any race, creed or gender.

@ABoxOfRocks23 I agree. We aren’t a refugee camp. I hate to be nasty about it but there should be some restrictions just like our ridiculous immigration system for people to come into Texas for residency.
@AlexDellasandro @xx_julesxx @PlanBianca @JillJmanches @JoeBiden Yeah and fuck him for that gross tweet. He was widely condemned for that. And it should've never been said. He doesn't speak for Biden.Tho not to parse Fonda never mentioned ms13. It was about putting him in the detention centers they lock immigrant children into.

@paulsperry_ He has not fulfilled his promises.   Health care - he has NOTHING!  Drug prices- NOTHING!  Wall that Mexico was going to pay for??? 3 miles that we as taxpayers paid for.   He did give the top 3% a tax break.  NOTHING for the middle   Class.  What did he do that you’re proud of?
@CNNPolitics The American People deserve to know exactly how many illegals are living in our country and especially how many are receiving any type benefits that are funded by US citizen's tax dollars – This is The USA, it's our citizen's country and being a US Citizen is absolutely relevant.

Daniel Cameron was under the assumption that we wouldn’t know how the law worked &amp; we’d accept this sham &amp; his findings on it as fait accompli. WRONG! Only trump voters can be misled like that, we check and then double check. We would’ve looked for the wall by now.

The US only accepted 18k refugees last year. Biden wants to increase that to 125k (good!). 125k immigrants, even if all inexplicably sent to Minnesota with its population of 5.6M, would not turn the state into a 'refugee camp.'This is just unabashed racism from Trump. https://t.co/peGvIm6VuS

@RealJamesWoods Blame it on Trump - his brain dead economic, fiscal &amp; trade policies have resulted in massive layoffs &amp; bankruptcies across the country.&amp; where is the money from Mexico to pay for "the wall"?  &amp; the hundreds of billions in tariffs he's supposed to be receiving from China? 
@realDonaldTrump -Mexico didn't pay for the WALL-Trump didn't bring our Troops HOME-Trump had no Health Care Plan for AMERICA-Trump didn't balance the BUDGET-Trump's Stupidity Collapsed Our ECONOMY-Trump'sStupidity put MILLIONS out of WORK-Trump's Stupidity killed 200,000+ Americans https://t.co/pTcrxFgsxv

@MSNBC The entire premise of these so-called "sanctuary cities and states" is absurd and random diversity immigration lotteries, unlimited chain migration and the continuous flood of uninvited unauthorized foreign intruders are ridiculous.
How about that dual citizenship?
@MSNBC The American People deserve to know exactly how many illegals are living in our country and especially how many are receiving any type benefits that are funded by US citizen's tax dollars – This is The USA, it's our citizen's country and being a US Citizen is absolutely relevant.
@paulsperry_ --where's the wall and did Mexico pay for any of it?--where's the healthcare plan?--he's only pro-american if you're white--where's the infrastructure?--Trump is a racist Mob boss with the intellect of a fifth grade bully.
@HippyWeeb @darcey_curran @frizzrigger99 @YoitsGilly @claytonsmith_10 Nah, you just can’t read very well  Trump &amp; millions of other Americans like myself want hard working Mexicans to leave Mexico for a chance at the American dream. But just letting MS13 &amp; other murderers to pour into this country if Biden is president doesn’t sound too good

8 USC 1158 AsylumAny alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival...), irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum https://t.co/zr0vsjuNal
Yo, Duluth and Minnesota!! My people!!! You are better than TRUMP!! My Dad, 82, Navy dude, born and raised in Superior across the bridge would NEVER side with this disgusting ‘man’. Vote Biden!! PS- we’re all immigrants up there! #EndRacism https://t.co/lew2MFK2eM
@ZaidJilani Honestly? Because it’s hard to get citizenship in all the cool countries.
@scparks70 @SenKamalaHarris @GavinNewsom Groveling and lying the whole time to the President; then newscum takes that money and puts homeless in motels with their drugs and syringes and gives the illegals health care!!! #recall newsom #ObamaGate_TREASON #Trump2020NowMoreThanEver
@MSNBC – Every day more and more Americans are waking up – Wanting trade and immigration policies that will put the best interests of our own US CITIZENS first and foremost is not racist or fascist – It's common sense, if you're a US CITIZEN of any race, creed or gender.
@MSNBC If they have funds available to subsidize these non-citizen uninvited unauthorized foreign intruders and their children, it should instead be going towards softening the hardship of these overbearing college loan repayments for our own income-tax-paying US Citizens instead.
Trump is even more a doer than a sayer. So, got Mexico to use their military to help impede the flow of illegals into our country. https://t.co/8ke0oI8ddE
@Sethrogen I mean, the president is literally going to Minnesota screaming about how scary REFUGEES are, on the day it's announced they are trying to reduce refugee intake to 0. It's white supremacist ideology on the loudspeaker. It doesn't take much analysis to call it what it is.
@alecsback .... i am an american citizen. because i am residing here... legally.
@realDonaldTrump But don’t forget the main reason people don’t like you.- you’re racist -you have not done anything to help people through the virus- you separated peoples family when you built the wall- you have kids in cages just because they wanted to come to America.
@oliverdarcy @TimMurtaugh @jaketapper Only 5 miles of NEW wall got built, Mexico didn't pay, deficit's skyrocketed, millions are unemployed, &amp; instead of being 'great again,' America leads the global pandemic with thousands having died and dying. Y'all got played! @gop @realDonaldTrump #DictatorTrump #GOPTraitors https://t.co/cPPb2Ru03e
I saw a documentary about how they are refugees and MN agreed to give them a home, there was a monetary exchange. They are citizens, they work, and they support the US more than any trailer trash I saw in 10+ years in the South. AND her Dad just died from #TrumpVirus Vote him OUT https://t.co/ykhBKERzpR
@MSNBC The American People deserve to know exactly how many illegals are living in our country and especially how many are receiving any type benefits that are funded by US citizen's tax dollars – This is The USA, it's our citizen's country and being a US Citizen is absolutely relevant.

@AnotherEsqInNYC @mmadkerk @AdamSchiavone @guypbenson One last thing, then off the soapbox.....I feel bad for Dreamers.  It is a tough one.  But Reagan gave amnesty once. It wasn’t fixed.  Both parties and Dreamer parents are to blame.  I like the wall idea.  Then find a resolution for Dreamers.
@SpeakerPelosi @stevenmnuchin1 No stimulus 2 illegals.

@AnotherEsqInNYC @mmadkerk @AdamSchiavone @guypbenson And it’s not Socialism if my rates go up because of me.  It is Socialism when those who work have to give what they earn, and it is given to those who don’t, for free.  People in CA still don’t have unemployment but Newsom gave it to illegals (first) no questions asked, cash.
@RealKaylaJames I have family in German and my mom is still a citizen, so I guess if I had to bail thats here id go, but im more the fighting type and would rather go down swinging
This is a campaign slogan, not policy - but one with real-world consequences. Steady, principled support of refugees is a humanitarian imperative, a benefit to the US, and furthers the cause of freedom. The president’s scapegoating of refugees is pathetic and shameful. https://t.co/TcvtTr1Thd

@joshrogin He was kicked out of the Navy for illegal drug use.Jumped on his dead brother's widow and is a deadbeat dad.Nevermind getting paid millions by our foreign adversaries and associates of a human trafficking ring while his daddy was VP.Awesome guy
@paulsperry_ He promised Mexico would pay for the wall..... that hasn't been built......
@enigmaman4 @MSNBC this so stupid! Trump is not God, maybe you forget?He closed the border earlier while Biden criticized him as a xenophobe, apparently Biden was slow to react when the pandemic hit, but the Dem ignored those facts!

That wall Trump wanted to build was never meant to keep “immigrants” out: it was meant to keep us(people of captivity) IN. The government KNOWS the Messiah coming back to gather His people and take us back to our land where we’re truly FREE. So they tryna keep us here in bondage.

@realDonaldTrump I would like to offer a rebuttal.-- Has Mexico paid for the wall? Is Trump's health care plan a law?-- And as a consequence he can't compromise--Americans pay their taxes. Nationalism has never been good foreign policy-- Fighting never results in compromise or concession
Funny part is for @USCIS, both @L1 and @H1B are same in #India, where as @L1 visa holders are simply a transfer to the US from their companies and @H1B visa holders are highly talented with American degrees. But for @citizenship and @green_cards, @L1 visa holders get preference!
@Marylandmike4 @duhlinduh @MarkRuffalo He's anti- all immigrants. You know there's a bunch of asylum seekers in cages right now right being refused to apply for asylum?

@paulsperry_ Hasn’t built the wall, Mexico did not pay for parts that were built; no repeal/replace healthcare plan; no infrastructure plan; failure to deal w/ virus; if by not ‘politically correct’ &amp; ‘fights back’ you mean bullying, stoking racism &amp; division, being obnoxious...you got that!
@NBCNews The American People deserve to know exactly how many illegals are living in our country and especially how many are receiving any type benefits that are funded by US citizen's tax dollars – This is The USA, it's our citizen's country and being a US Citizen is absolutely relevant.
In human terms, this means families forced to postpone reunification with their loved ones. It means thousands who would otherwise find safety on our shores left to languish in refugee camps, with no end in sight.

@AliceFromQueens There’s some question about amnesty, not just for DACA folks, makes it into this first order of prioritization. I fear splitting the DACA ‘most-sympathetic’ from the rest of the group has made it harder to do amnesty for the latter.
@moneyfearhunger NO NO NO!!! The DACA fee was NEVER going to go up at all!!! And FYI you missed the ACTUAL news.. a federal judge has blocked these fee changes that were suppose to go into affect on Oct. 2nd..

@AliceFromQueens But swing constituencies tilting against immigration, and Latin voters de-polarizing somewhat, makes me think maybe DACA amnesty might be... the biggest possible win there. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

@realDonaldTrump Here's why:  It's all about the cult!-- Trump pledged that Mexico will pay for the border wall-- Trump is never correct about anything political-- Trump is consistently &amp; unapologetically pro-racist-- Trump even when he's wrong, he doubles down-- Trump is only for Trump
@alvarombedoya @Litzz11 @polarisproject Instead you chose to focus entirely on how the software is used to enforce America's immigration policies, as though that is an evil thing to do. Are you for open borders? Once someone has immigrated illegally, should the USA not have the right to deport him?

@brhodes @IlhanMN Obama ini-dated life in many communities base on his own personal mission that brought us many MS-13 members/ others confused and dazed by where they ended up/for what?
@SpeakerPelosi @stevenmnuchin1 Continue when? When citizens are evicted, starving, homeless, through no fault of their own? Our country needs HELP 3 months ago. Get off your power trips and pass a relief package. You each serve Americans, not visa versa.
@kaylabrackson @liltwin1101 @Public_Citizen The House bill addressing evictions and homelessness resulted from "federal attention" to the situation. The problem is that most of the federal govt is run by Republicans, and they don't give a damn.If Newsom isn't enforcing his own laws, complain to Newsom, not to Porter.

@countrygonecool @paulsperry_ No wall; Mexico didn’t pay.. jobs still going oversees. Obamacare not replaced; no plan for what he’s going to do, but still suing in to get rid of it, so threatening to strip millions of Americans of their healthcare in the middle of a pandemic..,really you just like the racism.
@LindseyGrahamSC Support you??? I want to deport you. Don’t want to soil our prisons with your filth
@JRubinBlogger Apparently there is a refugee camp called Minnesota, we can send them there.

@realDonaldTrump We need to have voting by phone. Safe. Secure. Many more would vote. No fraud. No illegal immigrants. No discrimination. One American Citizen. One G-issued SS#. Instant results tallied digitally. No fear of human interference.
@Duane10561631 @MrMichaelBurkes You might want to think about voting after all. Trump will protect your 2nd amendment rights, stop Socialism from taking over America, finish the wall and stop Biden from packing the supreme court. Stop amnesty to millions of illegals. And that's just some. USA will be is gone.

@AtomicMexican77 @LRosestars @GavinNewsom How did a conversation about reparations become a mandate for you to pay? ICE does more than deport illegals, good!  We pay taxes and our money goes where it goes. There is no ballot initiative right now, calm down. If it does, vote how you want to. It’s your prerogative.
@Angilina32 @steveeo13 Checks for illegals? That's obviously a no starter. I hope the @TheDemocrats and @SpeakerPelosi lose Congress over this 2nd stimulus and extra unemployment standoff. The Republicans don't want any of it and now they both play the blame game. Meanwhile, they all get richer.
